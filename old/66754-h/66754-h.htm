In the Green Tree</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DAVID VALLORY&#8217;S train, to make which
he had precipitately thrown down pencil
and mapping-pen in the drafting room of the
Government harbor-deepening project on the
Florida coast two days earlier, was an hour late
arriving at Middleboro; and in this first home-coming
from the distant assignment, the aspect of
things once so familiar seemed jarred a trifle out
of focus. It was not that the June fields were
less green, or the factory suburb through which
the long train was slowing more littered and unsightly.
But there was a change, and it was in
a manner depressive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your home town?&#8221; inquired the traveler in
the opposite half of the Pullman section, as Vallory
began to assemble his various belongings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said David, adding, as if in some sort
of justification: &#8220;I was born here in Middleboro.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man who had occupied the upper berth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
looked aside reflectively, taking in and appraising
the country-town tritenesses as the open car
windows passed them in review.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man may be born anywhere,&#8221; he remarked;
then, with the appraisive glance directed at the
fair-haired, frank-faced young man kneeling to
strap an over-filled suit case; &#8220;It&#8217;s a safe bet that
you&#8217;ll not die in Middleboro&mdash;unless you should
chance to be killed in an accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vallory, soberly preoccupied, looked up from
the strapping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The older man smiled with a rather grim
widening of the thin lips half hidden by a cropped
beard and mustaches.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are young, and youth is always impatient
of the little horizons. Let me make another
guess. You have been away for some time, and
this is your first return. You are finding it a bit
disappointing. Am I right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly disappointing,&#8221; Vallory denied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, different, let us say. You may not
realize it yet, but you have outgrown the home
town. I know, because, years ago, I had precisely
the same experience myself. Do your people
live here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The train had been halted in the yard by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
dropped semaphore arm, and for the moment
Vallory was at the mercy of his chance traveling
companion. Yet he told himself that there was
no good reason why he should be churlish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he conceded; &#8220;my father and sister live
here. And I have lived here all my life except
for the four years in college, and the past two
years in Florida.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;College&mdash;to be sure,&#8221; the inquisitor agreed
half absently. &#8220;What course, if I may ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Engineering.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the bearded man exhibited a tiny fob
charm made in the shape of a simple trestle bent
and extended a hand individualized by the spatulate
thumb and square-ended fingers of the artist-artisan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shake!&#8221; he exclaimed, with something more
than Middle-Western informality. &#8220;I happen to
be one of the same breed. Now I am quite certain
you won&#8217;t die here in&mdash;Middletown?&mdash;is that
the name?&mdash;always making an exception in favor
of the untoward accident, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Middleboro,&#8221; David corrected. Then to the
repetition of the prophecy: &#8220;You are probably
right. I found that I had to leave home to get
my first job. I have been on Government work
in Florida&mdash;rivers and harbors.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>&#8220;Government work? A deep grave and a safe
one. Would you mind telling me just why you
chose to bury yourself in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Vallory&#8217;s smile was still good-natured. For
so young a man he was singularly free from the
false dignity which so often is made to pass for
the real.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind in the least. I did what most
college men do; took the first reasonably decent
thing that offered. It wasn&#8217;t at all what I wanted,
but my own particular line was rather dull two
years ago. I majored in railroad building.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Railroad building, eh? That&#8217;s my trade, too,&#8221;
said the other. Then, with an overlooking glance
that was too frankly a renewal of the appraisive
summing-up to be mistaken for anything else:
&#8220;You&#8217;ll go far, my young friend&mdash;if you&#8217;re not
too good.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory&#8217;s smile broadened into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But what do you mean
by &#8216;too good&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely what I say; no more and no less.
You can take it from a total stranger, can&#8217;t you?
You have a good jaw, and I shouldn&#8217;t care to get
in your way if you had any reason to wish to beat
me up. But your eyes tell another story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vallory had a telegram in his pocket, the brief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
summons which, two days earlier, had caused him
to drop pen and pencil in the Florida office and
hasten to catch the first northbound train. There
was nothing in the wording of the message to
breed alarm; but the mere fact that his father had
telegraphed him to come home had awakened disturbing
qualms of anxiety. Wondering if he were
still youthful enough to advertise the disquietude
so plainly that a stranger might read the signs of
it, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go on; what do my eyes tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This: that in spite of your twenty-five, six, or
seven years, whatever they may be, you are still
sufficiently youthful and unspoiled to take things
at their face value. You believe good of a man
or a woman until the evil is proved, and even then
you change reluctantly. You hold your word as
binding as your oath. In short, you are still generous
enough to believe that the world is much
better than the muckrakers would make it out to
be. Isn&#8217;t this all true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be sorry if I had to contradict you,&#8221;
said Vallory soberly. &#8220;At that, you are only accusing
me of the common civilized humanities.
The world has been very decent to me, thus far.
Doesn&#8217;t it occur to you that a man usually finds
what he looks for in life?&mdash;that, as a general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
proposition, he gets just about what he is willing to
give?&#8221;</p>

<p>The bearded man shook his head, as one too
well seasoned to argue with unvictimized youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four years in college, and two in a Government
service which taught you absolutely nothing
about life as it is lived in a world of men and
women and sharply competitive business,&#8221; he
scoffed gently. &#8220;Ah, well; we&#8217;ll let it go with a
word of advice&mdash;advice from a man whose name
you don&#8217;t know, and whom you will most likely
never meet again. When you come to take the
plunge; the real plunge into the sure-enough puddle
of life as it is lived by most men and not a few
women; don&#8217;t tie up too hard with any man or set
of men, or yet to those old-fashioned principles
which you have been taught to regard as law and
Gospel. If you do, you won&#8217;t succeed&mdash;in the
only sense in which the world measures success.&#8221;</p>

<p>The train was moving on again, and Vallory
was not sorry. Being healthily suspicious of cynicism
in any of its forms, he was glad that his
critical section mate had not chosen to begin on
him at the dining-car breakfast, where they had
first met. None the less, at the station stop he
shook hands with the volunteer prophet of evil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to hear your estimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
of the next man with whom you happen to
share a Pullman section. But part of your prediction
will doubtless come true. I have definitely
broken away from the Government job, and I
shall probably not stay very long in Middleboro.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he left the train he glanced at his watch. It
was past nine; therefore his father would be at
the bank. With only a hand-bag for encumbrance
he walked rapidly up the main street with the well-remembered
home town surroundings still making
their curiously depressive appeal.</p>

The Deluge</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Middleboro Security Bank, housed in a
modest two-storied brick three squares up
from the railroad station, seemed on that morning
of mornings to be a center of subdued excitement.
Early in the forenoon as it was, a
number of farm teams were halted at the curb, and
little knots of country folk and townspeople obstructed
the sidewalk. David Vallory nodded
good-morning to one and another in the groups
as he swung past, and was immediately conscious
of a sort of hushed restraint on the part of those
who returned his greetings.</p>

<p>In the bank an orderly throng was inching and
shuffling its way in sober silence to the paying
teller&#8217;s window. There were no signs of panic,
and any excitement that might underlie the unusual
crush of business seemed to be carefully suppressed.
But Vallory saw that old Abner Winkle,
and the clerk he had called into the cage to help
him, wore anxious faces; and Winkle&#8217;s hands, the
hands of a man who had grown gray in the service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
of the country-town bank, were tremulous and uncertain
as he counted out the money to the waiting
cheque-holders.</p>

<p>David made his way to the rear of the narrow
lobby, to a door with a ground-glass panel bearing
the word &#8220;President&#8221; in black lettering. He
entered without knocking, but was careful to snap
the catch of the lock to prevent a possible intrusion.
A tall, thinly bearded man, prematurely
white-haired, with a face that was almost effeminate
in its skin texture and the fineness of its lines,
and with the near-sighted eyes and round-shouldered
stoop of a student and book lover, got
rather uncertainly out of his chair at the old-fashioned
desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;David!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I knew you&#8217;d come,
and I&#8217;m glad you are here. Was the train late?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An hour or thereabouts. Didn&#8217;t you get my
answer to your wire?&#8221;</p>

<p>The older man put his hand to his head. &#8220;Did
I?&#8221; he asked half absently. &#8220;I suppose I must
have, if you sent one. I&mdash;I think I haven&#8217;t been
quite responsible since I telegraphed you. You
saw what is going on out in the bank; it has been
that way since day before yesterday. I waited as
long as I dared. I knew it would be a shock to
you, and I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t want to shock you, son.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>David Vallory placed a chair for himself at the
desk end and felt mechanically for his pipe and
tobacco. Disaster was plainly in the air and he
prepared himself to meet it.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re ready, Dad,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Adam Vallory sank into his chair. There was
a bit of string on the desk and he picked it up and
began aimlessly to untie the knots in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure you&#8217;d come; I didn&#8217;t know
whether you could come. It isn&#8217;t fair to take you
away from your work; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;d come!&#8221; David broke in warmly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m here to take hold with you, and you must
remember that there are two of us now. What
has gone wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>Adam Vallory shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing that went wrong dates back to a
time before you were born, David; to the time
when I allowed your grandfather, and some others,
to persuade me that I ought to make a business
man of myself. That was a mistake; a very
sorry mistake. I haven&#8217;t been a good banker.&#8221;</p>

<p>David shook his head in honest filial deprecation.
&#8220;You have been the best and kindest of
fathers to Lucille and me, and that counts for
much more than being a successful money-grabber.
And you&#8217;ve earned the love and respect of everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
worth while in Middleboro. What is the
present trouble? Are you having a run on the
bank?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you wouldn&#8217;t call it a run, as yet.
There is no special excitement and the people are
very quiet and orderly. But there have been a
great many withdrawals, and there will doubtless
be more. If it should come to a real run&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me have it all,&#8221; the son encouraged, when
the pause grew over-long. &#8220;Do you mean that the
bank isn&#8217;t solvent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not,&#8221; was the low-toned rejoinder, given
without qualification. &#8220;I have made a number of
bad loans. So long as I had to deal only with
neighbors and friends, men whom I have known
and trusted all my life, I got along fairly well,
though the bank has never earned much more than
the family living, as you know. But when the
town began to grow and the factories came in
the conditions were changed&mdash;for me. Then
Mugridge started the Middleboro National, and
that was the beginning of the end. He took his
pick of the new customers and let me have the fag
ends. The Stove Works went into bankruptcy a
week ago, and that was the last straw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were carrying Carnaby, of the Stove
Works?&#8221; David asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;Yes; and for much more than his capitalization,
or our resources, would warrant. He has
been very smooth and plausible, and I have believed
in him, as I have in others. The story of
my involvement with Carnaby leaked out, as such
stories always do. As I have said, there has been
no panic; just the steady stream of withdrawals
and account-closings. It&#8217;s telling on us fast now,
and the end is practically in sight. This is no
world for the idealist in business, David.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory was silent for a time, leaning
forward with his elbows on his knees and his chin
propped in his palms. His pipe had gone out,
but he still held it clamped between his teeth. In
Middleboro tradition it was said that he favored
his mother&#8217;s people, and the square-set, firm-lipped
mouth bore out the assertion. But the good gray
eyes were, not the eyes of a dreamer, perhaps, but
the eyes of the son of a dreamer; more&mdash;they
were the eyes of a man who had not yet outgrown
the illusions. Adam Vallory had matured slowly;
he was in his thirties when he married. And the
slow maturing process seemed to have been
handed on to the son. A stronger man than his
father, this David, one would have said; though
perhaps only as athletic youth is stronger than
age. And a close observer, like the crop-bearded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
stranger of the Pullman car, might have added
that the strength was idealistic rather than practical;
a certain potency of endurance rather than
of militancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just how bad is it&mdash;in actual figures?&#8221; the son
asked, at the end of the chin-nursing pause.</p>

<p>Adam Vallory closed his eyes as one wearied
and stunned in the clash and clamor of a battle too
great for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can go on paying out to-day, and perhaps
to-morrow. Beyond that, there is failure for the
bank; and&mdash;and beyond the failure, David, there
is a prison for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger man straightened up quickly and
there was unfeigned horror in the good gray eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens, Dad!&mdash;you don&#8217;t mean anything
like that!&#8221; he exclaimed in a shocked voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I didn&#8217;t, son, but it is true. I have been
weak; criminally weak, some will say. All along
I have been clinging desperately to the hope that
I could pull through; that the bad paper the bank
is holding would somehow miraculously turn into
good paper. A better business man would have
faced the worst weeks ago. I didn&#8217;t. We have
gone on receiving deposits when I knew that we
were, to all intents and purposes, insolvent. That,
as you know, is a penitentiary offense.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>David Vallory got upon his feet and began to
pace up and down the length of the small room,
three strides and a turn. It was his maiden projection
into the jostling arena of business, and for
the moment he could only struggle hardily for
standing room in it. He had always known, in
a general way, that his book-loving father was no
money-getter in any modern sense of the term,
but there had always been enough and something
to spare for him and for the blind sister whose
birth had cost the mother&#8217;s life. With the healthy
ambition of the average boy and youth, he had
looked forward to a time when he should go to
work for himself in some chosen field and manfully
build up the slender fortunes of the family.
But now the world of youthful anticipation had
gone suddenly and hopelessly awry.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t think of giving up, Dad!&#8221; he broke
out, after he had tramped his way through to some
measure of decision. &#8220;There must be something
that we can turn into money and save the bank
and your good name. Can&#8217;t you find somebody
who will carry you until we can make the turn?&#8221;</p>

<p>Adam Vallory shook his head in patient despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;That ground has all been plowed long ago,
son. It is now six months or more since I began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
borrowing on my private resources, such as they
are. There is nothing left; not even the house
we live in. I suppose I should have told you
sooner, but that was another weakness. I wished
you to have a chance to finish your college course
and get your start in the world without distractions,
and that much, at least, has been accomplished.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the younger man sought to stem the
torrent of the incredible reversals, and this time
he was partly successful.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can still hope that it isn&#8217;t altogether as bad
as you think it is, Dad,&#8221; he said, with greater optimism
than his inner conviction warranted. &#8220;In
a few minutes I&#8217;m going to pull off my coat and
have a look at things from the inside. We&#8217;re not
going down without a fight; that&#8217;s settled. Aside
from this prison scare&mdash;and it&#8217;s only a scare, you
know&mdash;no Middleboro jury would ever believe for
a single moment that you meant to do a criminal
act&mdash;aside from that, there are two mighty good
reasons why we mustn&#8217;t go to the dogs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucille?&#8221; queried the father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; she is one of the reasons, and a pretty
stout one. Life is always going to be hard enough
for the little sister, without adding poverty and a
sorrow that she can neither help nor hinder.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;Quite true; and the other reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory had sat down again, and a boyish
flush came to darken the healthy brown which
was the gift of a more or less athletic youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t intend to tell you&mdash;not just yet,&#8221; he
demurred; &#8220;at least, not until I had shown you
that I could make good on my own, and prove that
you haven&#8217;t been throwing your money away on
me. I&mdash;I&#8217;ve found the girl, Dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>The older man leaned back in his chair and the
tired eyes were closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is natural, and was to be expected,&#8221; he
acquiesced. &#8220;You have been very moderate,
David. Many another young fellow would have
found, not one girl, but a round dozen, before
reaching your age.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory&#8217;s laugh matched the absurdity of
the &#8220;round dozen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing like that; I&#8217;m not built that way, I
guess,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;There is only one girl, and
though I hadn&#8217;t realized it until lately, I think I
discovered her to be that one while I was still
wearing knickerbockers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adam Vallory nodded as one who understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have often wondered if it might not turn out
that way,&#8221; he said; &#8220;wondered and been just a
trifle&mdash;no, I won&#8217;t say it. Judith is a good girl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
and she will doubtless make you a warm-hearted,
loyal wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Judith?&#8221; said David, and now his flush was
darker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You thought you were mighty secret
about it, but I knew it, all along; knew that you
were corresponding with her while you were at
college, and missed you every time you spent an
evening at the Fallons&#8217;. It&#8217;s all right, son. I
haven&#8217;t a word to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;you&#8217;re tremendously mistaken,
Dad!&#8221; the younger man protested earnestly.
&#8220;There has never been anything serious between
Judith and me. We were just good chums together
in school, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on a minute, son,&#8221; said Adam Vallory
gently. &#8220;We have no money, but we still have a
few traditions. One of them is that no man of
the Vallory name has ever put the burden of proof
on a woman, so far as the records show. You
admit that you wrote to Judith while you were in
college, and all Middleboro knows that you were
always going about with her in your vacations.
Haven&#8217;t you been writing back and forth while
you were in Florida?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; now and then, of course. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are trying to tell me that I have guessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
wrong. Before you go any farther, let me say
this: your relations with Judith may have meant
nothing to you; but how about Judith herself?
She is warm-blooded, ardent, and much more mature
than you are, in spite of the difference in your
ages. Be very sure that you don&#8217;t owe her something,
David&mdash;the biggest debt that a woman can
ever hold against a man. Now go on and tell me
as much as you care to about the other girl&mdash;the
real one.&#8221;</p>

<p>David was still showing the marks of disturbance,
but he went on manfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t so very much to tell. I&#8217;ve&mdash;well,
I&#8217;ve just found her, that&#8217;s all. I met her last
winter at Palm Beach. She was down there with
a bunch of New York people who go there every
year. Raglan, my chief on the Government job,
knew her and some of her New York friends. He
began to introduce me, but she laughed and said,
&#8216;Mr. Vallory and I were rocked in the same cradle&mdash;in
Old Middleboro,&#8217; and that settled it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The beaten man in the desk chair roused himself
to say: &#8220;Then you did know her as a child?
She belongs here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now. She is a citizen of a very much
larger world.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;Do I know her, or her people?&mdash;but of course
I must.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do. You have held her on your knee and
told her fairy tales many a time, while I stood by
and listened. Doesn&#8217;t that place her for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Adam Vallory shook his head with a smile that
was reminiscent of pleasanter things than the navigating
of stormy seas in a sinking business craft.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have held many little girls on my knee to
tell them fairy stories, David. That is another
reason why I should never have been a banker;
I love children&mdash;and fairy tales&mdash;far too well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would never guess,&#8221; said David, with all
the fatuousness of the new-born lover. &#8220;Yet you
and her father were schoolboys together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adam Vallory roused himself again. &#8220;Not
Eben Grillage?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; she is Mr. Grillage&#8217;s daughter; the
brown-eyed little Vinnie we used to know; though
they all call her &#8216;Miss Virginia&#8217; now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the upcast of reminiscence came to make
the unsuccessful banker forget for the moment the
rotten business craft that was sinking beneath him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eben Grillage,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;He was, and is,
everything that I am not. He was a born leader,
even as a boy. Success, or what most people value
as success, has been his for the taking. You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
seen him, David? Is he growing old, as I am?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are old only in hard work; work that
doesn&#8217;t appeal to you,&#8221; the son said loyally.
Then: &#8220;I have met Mr. Grillage only once, and&mdash;well,
I guess he didn&#8217;t have much time to throw
away on an apprentice engineer who was just then
trying his prettiest to get a chance to talk over old
times with his daughter. I remember he asked
about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was in Florida?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I chased over to Palm Beach as often
as I could during the short season, but it didn&#8217;t do
me much good. There were too many other fellows
ahead of me. It was on one of these
trips that I met Mr. Grillage. He had run down
from some place in Georgia, where his company
was building a dam, to spend a week-end with his
daughter. The most that he said to me was in
the nature of a good-humored &#8216;josh&#8217; for burying
myself in a Government job.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adam Vallory nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t remember Vinnie&#8217;s mother, of
course; she died while you were still only a little
lad. She was what we, in my younger days, used
to call a belle; a most attractive woman, and as
true and good as she was beautiful. Eben Grillage
had none of the qualities that such women are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
supposed to care for&mdash;save one; he was big
enough and strong enough to reach out and take
what he wanted. He idolized his wife; and the
love which was hers while she lived has been carried
along to his daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any one can see that,&#8221; said David, laughing.
&#8220;Virginia is the apple of his eye. Have you kept
in touch with him at all since he left Middleboro?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only at long intervals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say he is rich, and rapidly growing
richer. He has made the Grillage Engineering
Company; built it from the ground up; and there
isn&#8217;t any undertaking too big for him to tackle
and carry through. If he wasn&#8217;t Virginia&#8217;s father,
I&#8217;d strike him for a job&mdash;after we get things
straightened out here for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would do well by you, for old times&#8217; sake,
I don&#8217;t doubt. To me, Eben Grillage has never
been the hard man that others seem to find him;
he is still the loyal friend of the boyhood days&mdash;our
boyhood. Different as we were, or perhaps
just because of that difference, we were like brothers.
Why should the fact that he is Vinnie&#8217;s
father make you hold back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I could explain it, even to
you, Dad. But, somehow, I should feel handcapped.
Virginia has a mighty keen, sharp-edged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
little mind of her own. I have a notion that she
wouldn&#8217;t think much of a fellow that her father
was nursing along by hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right. But tell me more
about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish there were more to tell. I have met
her a few times, and she has been mighty sweet to
me&mdash;for the sake of the kiddie days here in Middleboro,
as she occasionally took care to remind
me. I&#8217;m not in her set, you know; not even in the
outer edges of it. Besides, as I have said, she
has a string of fellows as long as your arm. It&#8217;s
only a pipe-dream for me, as yet, and I&#8217;m going to
forget all about it now, until after we&#8217;ve staved off
this trouble of yours. Will you turn me loose
among the money papers and securities? I&#8217;d like
to make a few figures for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this for a beginning, David Vallory&#8217;s first
day in the home town resolved itself into a grind
of hard work. Through what was left of the
forenoon, and straight on to three o&#8217;clock&mdash;welcome
hour when the bank doors were shut upon
the public, and the tired old paying teller and his
assistant had an opportunity to balance their cash&mdash;the
young man probed steadily, sometimes with
his father at his elbow, but oftener alone.</p>

<p>What he discovered sobered him at first, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
later evoked symptoms of a panicky nature. The
Middleboro Security, a one-man bank in all that
the term implies, was&mdash;unless some of the bad
paper could be redeemed&mdash;plainly insolvent; and,
what was much worse, the insolvent condition was
of long standing. The failure of the Carnaby
Stove Works had been merely the tiring spark to
set off the explosion. Without immediate help;
help that must run into the tens of thousands; the
bank must close its doors.</p>

<p>Though the June afternoon was not oppressively
warm, David Vallory found himself sweating
profusely when the final column of figures had
been added. In the quiet of the semi-darkened
bank, where Winkle and the three clerks were still
striving silently for their balances after the strenuous
business day, a menacing shadow fell. It
was not only ruin; it was ruin with disgrace.
David was far from holding his father responsible
in any moral sense, this though it was apparent
that the present state of affairs had been long
threatened. That it had not reached a climax
sooner was due chiefly to the fact that for many
years the country-town bank had done business
only with honest customers. David was not blind
to his father&#8217;s one amiable weakness. It was
known far and wide that Adam Vallory could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
never say &#8220;No&#8221; to a sufficiently importunate borrower;
also, that he judged all men by his own
upright standards.</p>

<p>David Vallory got up from the table-desk at
which he had been working and slowly struggled
into his coat. Grown man as he was, this was his
first rude collision with life in its commercial
aspect, and he rose from the preliminary grapple
with a belittling feeling of inadequacy; as if, as a
boy, he had been rudely buffeted into the gutter
by a man. But the feeling did not becloud the
clearly defined conclusion at which he had arrived.
He did not&mdash;could not&mdash;minify the impending
consequences. The bank examiner would come,
and at his coming the pitiless mill of publicity
would begin to grind. There would be exposure
and a criminal prosecution. Those who knew
Adam Vallory, the man, would refuse to believe
that he had consciously committed a crime; but to
the wider world he would figure merely as another
addition to the ranks of those who gamble with
other people&#8217;s money; a banker who had taken
the desperate chance involved in going on and
receiving deposits when there was no reasonable
hope of repaying the depositors.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned clock on the wall was striking
four as the volunteer checker of accounts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
gathered up the slips of scratch paper which he
had covered with figures and passed out to the
small room at the rear of the working space. The
gray-faced man bending dejectedly over his desk
and waiting had no illusions. &#8220;Well, son?&#8221; he
said, as David came in.</p>

<p>The young man dropped heavily into a chair
and sat for some moments staring at the slips of
scratch paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning when you told me where we
stood you didn&#8217;t make it any worse than it really
is,&#8221; he announced soberly. &#8220;Winkle gave me his
figures just now&mdash;the withdrawals for to-day. If
they come after us to-morrow as they have to-day,
we shan&#8217;t be able to last until three o&#8217;clock. I&#8217;ve
gone over everything in the vault with a fine-tooth
comb; we need something like a hundred thousand
dollars more than we have in sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adam Vallory&#8217;s gaze was fixed upon the dust-covered
steamship lithograph hanging above his
desk, but he saw the picture only with the outward
eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;A hundred thousand,&#8221; he repeated slowly.
&#8220;David, it might as well be a million. There is
no use. I shall telegraph to the bank examiner
to-night, and we won&#8217;t open the bank doors in the
morning.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III<br />


Eben Grillage</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT his father&#8217;s definite acknowledgment of
defeat David Vallory rose and thrust the
penciled sheets into his pocket, crumpling them
absently into a wad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you what to do,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I&#8217;m
too young and too raw; how raw I never realized
until to-day. Just the same, everything in me
rises up to yell for an endurance fight. Call it
stubbornness or anything you like, but I&#8217;d rather
be knocked out than squeezed out. Some of the
bad paper can be made good if we retain an up-to-date
lawyer and put the pressure on as if we meant
it. In the savings department we can gain time
by insisting upon the sixty days&#8217; notice of withdrawal
that the law allows. It&#8217;s tough to have
to go down without mixing it up a little with the
enemy, Dad!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; was the colorless reply. &#8220;But the
fight has all been taken out of me, David. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
mustn&#8217;t think that I&#8217;ve been sitting here in my
chair and letting things take their course without
making a struggle. It hasn&#8217;t been anything like
that. I&#8217;ve turned and twisted every way; have
borrowed to my limit and then tried to borrow
more. I&#8217;ve even gone practically on my knees
to Mugridge, of the new Middleboro National.
He was as cold as a fish; told me that I ought to
push my collections.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you consulted a lawyer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not specifically. Young Oswald has known
about how things were going, and he has advised
me&mdash;as a friend. He would make a legal fight
for us if I&#8217;d let him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bert Oswald is going to make himself the
rarest combination on earth&mdash;or at least he was
heading that way when he came out of the law
school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A combination?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a man who will be stubbornly honorable
and upright in spite of his profession.&#8221; David
Vallory was prone to magnify his own profession
to the detriment of some others, and in the engineering
school he had imbibed the technical man&#8217;s
suspicion of those who draw up contracts and
specifications only to leave loopholes of escape.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he would ever take a rascal&#8217;s retainer,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
he went on, adding: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
employ him?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Adam Vallory&#8217;s turn to show embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bert has been coming to the house rather
oftener than his boyhood friendship with you
would seem to warrant,&#8221; he returned half reluctantly.
&#8220;This morning you gave me your reason
for not wishing to take service under Eben Grillage.
Can&#8217;t you imagine that I may have a somewhat
similar reason for not wishing to involve
young Oswald in this sorry business of ours?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a new surprise for David. &#8220;Lucille?&#8221;
he queried.</p>

<p>Adam Vallory nodded. &#8220;It can come to nothing,
of course. Lucille, herself, would be the first
to insist that one with her affliction has no right to
become a wife and mother. Yet it has been a
great comfort to her to have Oswald dropping in
at odd moments, or for an evening. He understands
her thoroughly, shares her keen love for
music, and all that. He has even taught her to
play chess and to do a number of things that we
have never thought she was able to attempt. For
her sake we mustn&#8217;t drag him into this mess of
ours, David.&#8221;</p>

<p>This hesitantly given explanation opened a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
field of dismay for David Vallory. As it seemed,
there was a separate and distinct disaster reaching
out for each member of the little family of three
persons; the grim threat hanging over his father,
the indefinite postponement of his own embryo
love affair, and now this portentous problem of
Lucille&#8217;s happiness. His love for the blind sister
was deep and tender, as it should have been, and
at the moment his own affair shrank to inconsequence,
as it was constrained to when he realized
how heavily the blow would fall upon one who
had been sheltered and protected in every way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have fully made up your mind to wire for
the examiner to-night?&#8221; he asked, after another
interval filled with blind gropings for a helpful
suggestion.</p>

<p>Adam Vallory looked away toward the window
and through it to the empty country-town street
beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no use in prolonging the agony,
David. The day of reckoning has come, and a
few hours one way or another can make no possible
difference. I shall have to face the music in
the end; we shall all three have to face it, more is
the pity. If there were the slenderest chance of
escape&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The interruption, voices in the adjoining banking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
room, gruff tones raised emphatically, and
Winkle&#8217;s more moderate ones parroting excuses
and explanations came over the half-height partition
of the rear office. It culminated now in an
abrupt opening of the door of privacy. The intruder,
whom Winkle had apparently been trying
to bar out, was a big man with a clean-shaven face
in which each feature seemed to have been massively
exaggerated to make it harmonize with the
gigantic figure; a great Roman beak of a nose; a
hard-bitted mouth buttressed by a jaw over which
the heavy cheeks hung like the dewlaps of a bulldog;
strong teeth clamping the blackest of cigars;
shrewd eyes that glared from beneath penthouse
brows; in short, a man who, in the Stone Age,
would have acquired the most commodious of the
caves and swung the heaviest of the clubs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adam&mdash;you old snipe!&#8221; was the giant&#8217;s explosive
greeting, and his hand-grip fairly lifted
the slighter man out of his chair. &#8220;Nice kind of
a welcome your watch-dog cashier out there was
trying to hand me: said you were busy and couldn&#8217;t
be interrupted! How are you, David, boy&#8221;&mdash;and
now it came David&#8217;s turn to wince under the
vigorous hand-grasp; at least, until he could summon
his athletic training and do a little bone crushing
on his own account.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>Adam Vallory, sunk fathoms deep in the pool
of despair but a moment before, made a generous
effort to rise to the hospitable requirements.</p>

<p>&#8220;You took us completely unawares, Eben; I
didn&#8217;t dream you were anywhere within a day&#8217;s
journey of old Middleboro. And Winkle&#8217;s eyesight
must be getting bad if he didn&#8217;t recognize
you. Sit down, if you can find a chair big enough
to hold you. It&#8217;s a pleasure to see your face
again; you don&#8217;t give me the chance any too often.
Now tell us what good wind has blown you back
to Middleboro.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man seated himself, and the chair,
though it was the stoutest one in the room, whined
its protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Business, Adam; always business. We have
an order in with your two-by-four equipment factory
here for a lot of scrapes and dump-cars, and
at the last minute Judson wired that he couldn&#8217;t
deliver on time. I didn&#8217;t happen to have anybody
to send, so I came down here to read the riot act
to Tom Judson. He&#8217;ll ship now; I&#8217;ve just been
out to see him.&#8221; Then to David: &#8220;Young man,
how soon can I get a train back to Chicago?&#8221;</p>

<p>David looked up the required information. The
next through train would leave at four minutes
past nine o&#8217;clock. The visitor glanced at a watch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
big enough and thick enough to have been used as
a missile.</p>

<p>&#8220;That gives us about four hours, Adam,&#8221; he
rumbled, &#8220;and we ought to be able to pull up a
good lot of the arrears in that length of time.
Shut up your desk and call it a day. We&#8217;ll trot
over to the hotel and be boys together for a little
while. David will stay here and wind up the odds
and ends of the day&#8217;s business for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adam Vallory was opening his mouth to protest
hospitably against the hotel, but his son broke
in ahead of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Mr. Grillage; I&#8217;m mighty glad
you can have a little time with Dad,&#8221; he interposed
quickly. &#8220;We were speaking of you this morning,
and I was telling Dad that I had met you for
a few minutes one day last winder in Florida. Take
him away with you, and I&#8217;ll stay and close the
bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy!&#8221; was the gruff rejoinder. &#8220;By and
by, when you get around to it, you may make a
sleeper reservation for me on that nine o&#8217;clock
train. Wire for it, and bring the answer over to
the hotel. No, Adam&#8221;&mdash;to the host who was trying
to make himself the entertainer instead of the
entertained&mdash;&#8220;no, you&#8217;re not going to take me
home with you, this time. I want you all to myself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
We&#8217;ll go to the St. Nicholas and make old
Vignaux give us one of his Frenchy dinners in a
private room. Get your hat and come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Left to himself, David Vallory checked over
the day&#8217;s transactions with Winkle, telegraphed
for the big man&#8217;s berth in the Chicago sleeping-car,
and then walked out to the tree-shaded suburb
on the hill to eat his dinner with the sister whom
he had not yet seen. To his great satisfaction he
found young Herbert Oswald at the house, and
the presence of the young lawyer, who was easily
persuaded to make a third at the family dinner-table,
pushed the disaster explanations, or such of
them as might have to be made to the blind girl,
a little farther into the future.</p>

<p>Though David forced himself to talk at the
table-for-three, his cheerful attempts to keep the
conversation in some safe middle-of-the-road channel
did not obscure for him the sentimental situation
developing under his eyes. Lucille, whose
delicate, rose-leaf beauty was a direct inheritance
from her father, was more animated than David
had ever seen her, and it was doubly hard to realize
that the softly lighted eyes, lifted shyly now
and again in Oswald&#8217;s direction, were sightless.
And as for the clean-cut, eager-faced young attorney,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
there was small effort at concealment on his
part.</p>

<p>David Vallory left the house after dinner with
a heavy heart. He had known Oswald all his life,
and liked him. He was well assured that the
young lawyer would stand by and be a very tower
of strength to the family in the storm which was
about to burst. But the outcome of it all would
be a swift conflagration in the sentimental field,
and a heart-breaking awakening for the blind sister,
who was obviously in love with Oswald without
at all realizing it. On the half-mile walk to
the St. Nicholas David Vallory told himself in
many and sternly emphatic repetitions that something
must be done to avert the triple-headed
calamity; though what the &#8220;something&#8221; should be
was entirely beyond his powers of imagination.</p>

<p>It was past eight o&#8217;clock when he reached the
town&#8217;s one hotel and found a quiet corner in the
small office-lobby where he could smoke and wait
for the two who were bringing up the boyhood
arrears in a private room above-stairs. When
the waiting interval ended, it was only the burly
guest-host who appeared, coming down from the
private-dining-room suite alone. Catching sight
of David, he crossed the lobby, cast his big body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
heavily into a chair, and lighted a cigar, the end
of which was already chewed into shapelessness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have sent Dad home?&#8221; inquired the son,
after he had delivered the telegram assuring one
Eben Grillage of a reserved space in the Chicago
sleeping-car.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;&mdash;disgustedly. &#8220;Some crazy farmer
broke in on us a few minutes ago and insisted on
taking your father over to the bank. Said he had
an option on a piece of land, and was obliged to
get his money to-night to make good on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>David winced. He knew perfectly well that
the excuse given had been only an excuse; that the
intruding farmer was merely one of the badly
frightened depositors in the Middleboro Security
who was afraid to wait for another day. He was
wondering how much or how little his father had
told Grillage of the threatened disaster when the
big man went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something the matter with your
father, David. All evening he&#8217;s been acting like
a man with a clot on his brain. Hasn&#8217;t been sick,
has he?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was one question that the son could answer
without reservations: &#8220;No; he hasn&#8217;t been
side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Then it&#8217;s business. How long have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
you been home, and how much do you know about
his banking affairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been here only one day, but I know all
there is to know, I guess,&#8221; said David, looking
down at the worn pattern of the linoleum on the
lobby floor.</p>

<p>The head of the Grillage Engineering Company
twisted himself in his chair and bored into
the young man at his side with the masterful eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Been here only one day, and yet you
know it all. That means that he&#8217;s up against it.
I knew it; it was bound to come sooner or later.
Anywhere else but in Middleboro he would have
gone on the rocks years ago; I&#8217;ve always told him
that. Shake it loose, young man, and give me
the facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>David hesitated in some manly fashion. If his
father had not seen fit to confide in the tried friend
of his youth, it was not for the son to take matters
into his own hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I have a right to do that,
Mr. Grillage,&#8221; he began. &#8220;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See here!&#8221; was the explosive interruption; &#8220;if
you knew me a little better, you wouldn&#8217;t make a
break like that. When I ask a man to loosen up,
he loosens, and that&#8217;s all there is to it. Dump it
out&mdash;all of it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>David, untried enough to feel that any sharing
of the dreadful thing would be a relief, hesitated
no longer. The secret would be published broadcast
in a day or two at most, so nothing mattered
much. In a few words he told the story of the
threatening catastrophe, exaggerating nothing,
minimizing nothing. Eben Grillage heard him
through without interrupting, shifting the chewed
cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other as
he listened. But at the end of the story he was
scowling ferociously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father is still the same kind of a tender-hearted
fool that he has always been!&#8221; he rapped
out. &#8220;Sat through an hour-and-a-half dinner with
me&mdash;dammit!&mdash;and never once opened his head
about this bog hole he&#8217;s mired in!&#8221; Then he
dragged out the biscuit-like watch. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got
barely fifteen minutes, young man. You go and
get Judson, the scrapers-and-dump-car man, on
the &#8217;phone, while I do a bit of figuring. Jump for
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory obeyed blindly, with his brain in
a whirl. It took several of the hastening minutes
to locate Judson at his home in the northern suburb,
and when the telephone connection was finally
made, the hotel porter was calling the Chicago
train and Eben Grillage was at the desk, paying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
his bill and growling out orders about his hand-baggage.
A moment later David had handed the
telephone receiver to the big-bodied man and was
listening mechanically to the audible half of the
conversation which began with shot-like directness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, this is Grillage.... No, I don&#8217;t want
to talk about the shipment; I want to know where
you do your banking.... With the Middleboro
National, you say? Well, this time you&#8217;ll do it
through my bank&mdash;the Middleboro Security. Get
that? Attach your draft to bill of lading and give
it to Adam Vallory. Otherwise you don&#8217;t get
your money. That&#8217;s all. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Train time, Mr. Grillage,&#8221; interrupted the
hotel clerk, in his most deferential tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right; you hold that &#8217;bus until I get
ready!&#8221; snapped the departing guest. Then,
thrusting a slip of paper into David&#8217;s hand: &#8220;Take
that to your father, with my love. And a word
to you, my boy&#8221;&mdash;this in a rumbling aside: &#8220;After
this &#8217;phone talk of mine gets handed about, your
father will have all the credit he needs; but just
the same, if you&#8217;ve got the level head that you
seem to have, you&#8217;ll stand by and wind this bank
business up, once for all. Your father&#8217;s too
damned good to be a banker in any such wicked
world as the one we&#8217;re living in. Dig up a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
lawyer, push the crooked borrowers to a settlement,
and see if you can&#8217;t screw enough out of it
to square up and leave your father and sister a
little something to live on. When it&#8217;s done, you
let me know by wire, and I&#8217;ll give you a job where
you can make good if you&#8217;ve got it in you. That&#8217;s
all I&#8217;ve got to say. Tell your father good-by for
me; I shan&#8217;t have time to stop at the bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not until after the crazy omnibus had
rattled away, bearing the St. Nicholas&#8217;s departing
guest in galloping haste for the train, that David
Vallory ventured to glance at the slip of paper
which had been shoved into his hand. For an instant
the figures on it dazzled him and he had a
rush of blood to the brain that made the electric
lights in the hotel lobby coruscate and take on
many-colored halos.</p>

<p>The slip of paper was Eben Grillage&#8217;s personal
cheque on a Chicago bank for the round sum of
one hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV<br />


An Honorable Discharge</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DAVID VALLORY lost little time in crossing
the square from the St. Nicholas to the
bank corner; in point of fact, he was boyish
enough to run. In the bank he found his father
relocking the vault after having given the frightened
farmer his money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is your heart-action still pretty good, Dad?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;No high blood pressure, or anything
like that, is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, David. If I were as sound in mind as I
am in body&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But David would not let him finish. &#8220;Take a
look at this and tell the blues to go hang,&#8221; he
laughed, fishing the cheque of salvation out of an
inner pocket.</p>

<p>Adam Vallory held the strip of paper up to the
electric vault light, saw the figures and the signature,
and dropped back into a chair, shaken and
tremulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;David!&#8221; he gasped reproachfully. &#8220;Did you
tell him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>&#8220;I did. Because it was evident that you hadn&#8217;t
told him, I tried my best to dodge; but it was no
manner of use. When Mr. Eben Grillage goes
after a thing, he is not to be denied. He nearly bit
my head off when he saw that I was trying to keep
something from him. He said I was to give you
that piece of paper with his love; that was after
he&#8217;d ordered me to call Tom Judson on the &#8217;phone
for him and had told Judson that the Middleboro
Security was his bank, and that he must draw
through you for the money to pay for the shipment
of scrapers and dump-cars. He said it so
that the people standing around in the hotel lobby
couldn&#8217;t help hearing and knowing that he is backing
you. Isn&#8217;t that just about the finest thing you
ever heard of?&#8221;</p>

<p>Adam Vallory was shaking his head dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too fine, David; the obligation, even from
an old friend like Eben.... It&#8217;s crushing. But
we must consider it as a loan, no matter how he
regards it. Yet I don&#8217;t see how we shall ever be
able to pay it back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man had perched himself upon the
bookkeeper&#8217;s high stool, and he had his answer
ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been doing all the scrapping, thus far,
Dad, but now you must let me take my whirl at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
it. We&#8217;ll let the old ship go decently and honorably
ashore, and then climb out and save the
pieces. We&#8217;ll pay Mr. Grillage back all we can
rake and scrape out of the wreck; and beyond
that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&mdash;beyond that, what, son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds rather stagy, but I&#8217;m going to say
it. Beyond what money payment we may be able
to make, we shall owe Mr. Grillage a debt of gratitude
that will be canceled only when we are both
under the sod. That is about the way it strikes
me. I don&#8217;t care what people say about his business
methods and the way he rides rough-shod
over his competitors; that doesn&#8217;t cut any figure
in his relations with you. He has done this thing
for you, individually, and I don&#8217;t come even into
the outer edges of it; just the same, he has laid an
obligation upon me that I shall never live long
enough to forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long minute Adam Vallory sat staring
into vacancy. When he looked up it was to say:
&#8220;You are bone of my bone, David, and I thank
God for a son who can see eye to eye with me at
a time like this. And yet ... you are young,
David; in many ways you are younger than your
years. You are maturing slowly, just as I did.
Sometimes I&#8217;ve been afraid&mdash;afraid you might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
throw yourself into something as a boy throws
himself, without reserve, you know; blind to
everything but the one thing, whatever it might
be. If you can only have time to ripen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>David&#8217;s laugh was entirely care free. &#8220;That
was the way you talked when I went to college,
Dad, and again, when I left for Florida. I
haven&#8217;t noticed that I&#8217;m particularly raw, compared
with other men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; the father hastened to say, &#8220;it&#8217;s
just that, up to to-day, you&#8217;ve never had to shoulder
a man&#8217;s load. Perhaps I am foolishly apprehensive,
but the way in which you spoke just now
of our obligation&mdash;your obligation&mdash;to Eben Grillage....
I don&#8217;t know how to express it, but it
made me feel as I have sometimes felt before;
that if anything which you might conceive to be a
duty were pushing you, you&#8217;d shut your eyes and
go to any length.&#8221;</p>

<p>David laughed and shook his head. &#8220;Some day,
Dad, you&#8217;ll wake up and find that I&#8217;m a man
grown; or I hope you will. Just the same, we do
owe Mr. Grillage a lot more than we can ever
pay, and if it ever comes in my way to chop the
debt down a bit, you may be sure I&#8217;ll sharpen my
axe. Now, if you are not too wretchedly tired
and worn out, suppose we turn in and make our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
plans before we sleep. I told Lucille that we&#8217;d
most likely be late coming home and she won&#8217;t be
sitting up for us. To-morrow morning you&#8217;re
going to turn the winding up of this thing over to
me and let me save what I can. That is what Mr.
Grillage said I must do, and it is what I mean
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Deep into the night father and son sat together
in the private room in the rear, poring over the
books and bank paper and setting things in order
for the speedy beaching of the outworn business
ship. But it was not until after they had left the
bank and were walking home that David won his
final point.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall do as you think best, David,&#8221; the
father conceded, closing an argument which had
begun at the very outset of the planning. &#8220;If it
were left to me, I should probably be too easy with
the bank&#8217;s debtors, as I&#8217;ve always been. You may
retain Oswald, if you think best; only don&#8217;t let him
be too hard on the borrowers who are in difficulties.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following day saw the beginning of the
end for the oldest banking institution in the
county. At nine o&#8217;clock in the morning the cue
leading to Winkle&#8217;s wicket was formed again; but
in an hour or two the tide showed signs of turning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
At Oswald&#8217;s suggestion the Vallorys had posted a
notice in the bank window to the effect that Middleboro
Security was going out of business, and
inviting all who had claims upon the bank to present
them and get their money. Coincidently
with the posting of this notice, a rumor, starting
from nobody knew just where, began to pass from
lip to lip among the anxious depositors. It was
to the effect that Eben Grillage, well known in the
town and currently spoken of by his former townsmen
as a multimillionaire, was backing Adam
Vallory. The result was almost magical. First
one and then another dropped out of the line in
front of Winkle&#8217;s window; and by noon many of
those who had already withdrawn their savings
were coming back to furnish an object-lesson in
the mutability of human nature by begging Adam
Vallory to stay in business and reinstate them as
depositors.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon David persuaded his
father to go home, and himself took the chair at
the president&#8217;s desk, with Herbert Oswald at his
elbow. By evening a good beginning had been
made and the tangle was simplifying itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time is the thing we need to save,&#8221; said
David, as he and the young lawyer went together
to the St. Nicholas for their belated dinner. &#8220;Dad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
is needing a rest, and I&#8217;ve got to strike out
and do something for myself; something better
than making maps in a Government surveying
office. Naturally, I can&#8217;t go until after things are
wound up properly here, and Dad and Lucille are
provided for in some fashion. How long do you
think it is going to take?&#8221;</p>

<p>Oswald reserved his answer until after they
had found their places in the caf&eacute; and had given
their dinner order.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the time, it will probably ask for more
than you will care to give to it,&#8221; he predicted;
&#8220;that is, if you mean to stay and see it through.
But that isn&#8217;t at all necessary. We can shake you
loose in a few days, after we have closed the bank
doors and have brought matters down to a routine
settlement with debtors and creditors. I can handle
that part of it myself, as the bank&#8217;s counsel.&#8221;</p>

<p>In accordance with this outline of Oswald&#8217;s,
David Vallory stood by for the few days, taking
his father&#8217;s place in the bank and doing what he
could to hasten the beaching of the Security ship.
The end of that phase of it came when the last depositor
had chequed out his account, and Winkle
had closed his wicket for the final time. Only the
deferred collections remained, and these were
turned over to Oswald.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>In the evening of this climaxing day, David and
the young attorney were once more dining together
in Vignaux&#8217;s caf&eacute;. The strain was off, and
for the first time since his home-coming, David
was free to begin the consideration of his own
future. It was Oswald who gave the table talk
its start in the proper direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are footloose at last, David, and I can
imagine that you are mighty glad of it,&#8221; was the
way the start was given. &#8220;It has been a new experience
for you, and you have certainly buckled
down to it like a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>David&#8217;s smile was boyishly complacent. &#8220;Sure
I have; there was no reason why I shouldn&#8217;t.
Isn&#8217;t that what a man&#8217;s son is for, in the last
analysis?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. A good many sons don&#8217;t
seem to see it in that light; and in your case&mdash;well,
I&#8217;ve known you a long time, David, and I didn&#8217;t
think you had it in you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Faithful are the wounds of a friend,&#8217;&#8221; David
quoted, with a return of the good-natured smile.
&#8220;What have I done to make you think small of
me? Or is it something that I haven&#8217;t done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; was the thoughtful reply. &#8220;It&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
just&mdash;oh, well; I guess it is because we were boys
together, and I couldn&#8217;t seem to realize that you
have grown up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Dad are the limit. Do you realize
it now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-yes; to some extent. I&#8217;ve been watching
you through this business whirl. You&#8217;ve done
well; splendidly well. But it was the fighting of
the untrained soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it was. What I didn&#8217;t know of the
actual details of the business would have filled a
library.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t what I meant; I guess I can&#8217;t express
myself clearly enough to make you understand
just what it is that I do mean. It sizes itself
up something like this: you&#8217;re so wholesome
and straightforward and decent, David&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Break it off,&#8221; laughed David; &#8220;you make me
blush!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said the keen-eyed young fellow
across the table; &#8220;you do blush. Which is the
proof of the pudding. But I mustn&#8217;t devil you
when you&#8217;re tired; tired and more or less discouraged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Discouraged? Not a bit of it. Why should
I be discouraged?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most fellows would be, in your shoes. You&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
had every reason to believe that you were born
with a silver spoon in your mouth&mdash;or at least, a
triple-plated one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Not in a thousand years!&#8221; grinned the
son whose light was of a proper filial brightness.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve known all along that the Middleboro Security
would have to be wound up some time. Dad
is all the fine things you can say of him, Bert, but
he wasn&#8217;t cut out for a successful banker. He
knows it as well as anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oswald looked up questioningly. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t
any twinges of your own, Dave? It used to be
the town&#8217;s idea that you&#8217;d some day come back
and marry Judith Fallon and settle down to be
Vallory Number Two in the banking business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry Judith? What put that idea into the
town&#8217;s head&mdash;or yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did,&#8221; said Oswald gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott! Can&#8217;t a man be just ordinarily
chummy with a girl he&#8217;s known all his life without
having the gossips of a country-town tie a tin
can to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a number of them, yes; but with one,
no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bosh!&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t &#8216;bosh.&#8217; You&#8217;ve specialized on
Judith; I&#8217;ve seen it myself. Candidly, David,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
I&#8217;ve tried to shut my eyes to it, partly because I
hoped it might die out. Judith&#8217;s a good girl, and
in her own class she is the prettiest thing that was
ever turned loose in a world of more or less
squashy young men. But I can&#8217;t seem to see her
calling herself Mrs. Vallory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t try.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oswald&#8217;s eyebrows went up. &#8220;She has turned
you down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bert, if this place wasn&#8217;t so public I should
blow up! Good Lord, man! there has never been
anything sentimental between Judith and me!&mdash;nothing
on top of earth more than a bit of jolly
good-comradeship!&#8221;</p>

<p>Being already up, Oswald&#8217;s eyebrows stayed in
that position.</p>

<p>&#8220;On your part, perhaps; but how about Judith?
Listen, David: within the past month I&#8217;ve heard
half a dozen times that you and Judith were to
be married as soon as you got yourself relocated
in some more habitable place than a Florida
swamp. You may howl all you want to about
country-town gossip, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>This time David Vallory interrupted with a
twist of the square jaw that took Oswald swiftly
back to a day long remembered in Middleboro
school annals when David had plunged, head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
down, into battle with the leader of the &#8220;factory
gang&#8221; and had for all time vindicated the superiority
of &#8220;town-side&#8221; brain over mere brawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop it, Herbert,&#8221; he said quietly; and then:
&#8220;Let&#8217;s get back on the main track again. You
were saying that the town expected me to come
back and follow in Dad&#8217;s footsteps. There&#8217;s
nothing doing. In another way, I&#8217;m as incompetent
as he is. Money-handling doesn&#8217;t appeal to
me; it never has appealed to me. I&#8217;d rather go
out as a transit-man on some building job worth
while than to be the president of the biggest bank
in the State. It&#8217;s all in the way a man happens
to be built.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are beginning at the bottom in your profession,
though, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course; any man worth his salt begins that
way. And that brings us down to the finances
again. Have you carried the figuring far enough
along to be able to guess at what will be left after
all the bills are paid?&#8221;</p>

<p>Oswald shook his head. &#8220;Your father hasn&#8217;t
taken either of us fully into his confidence,&#8221; he
averred. &#8220;He insists that we must try to realize
on the assets so as to have a hundred thousand
dollars left to pay a personal debt which doesn&#8217;t
appear on the bank&#8217;s books. If we subtract even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
half of that amount from the most favorable outcome
at present in sight, there will be nothing of
any account left for him and your sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be enough; with what I may be able
to add to it,&#8221; said David, neither affirming nor
denying the lawyer&#8217;s hint that he was not entirely
in his father&#8217;s confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going away to look for a job?&#8221; Oswald
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;As it happens, I don&#8217;t have to look for one.
I leave for Chicago on the eleven-fifteen to-night,
and my job is waiting for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; was the friendly approval. &#8220;Is it a
secret?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. I&#8217;m going to work for the Grillage
Engineering Company; an assistant engineer&#8217;s
billet on a bridge construction job up in
Wisconsin. There is a reason why I shouldn&#8217;t
take the job, and a still stronger reason why I
can&#8217;t refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s capital!&#8221; said Oswald, ignoring the
qualifying part of the announcement. &#8220;You are
lucky&mdash;or I guess you are. They say Mr. Eben
Grillage can dig his profit out of the shrewdest
contract that was ever drawn and never turn a
hair. But as an engineer in the field, you won&#8217;t
have anything to do with that part of it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>David glanced up quickly with a little frown
coming and going between the honest eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again I&#8217;ll have to ask you to break it off,
Bert. Mr. Grillage is my father&#8217;s friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he is; I forgot for the moment,&#8221;
was the placative reply. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have repeated
the gossip&mdash;which is only gossip, after all.
I suppose you remember his daughter Vinnie, as
a little girl, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, indeed,&#8221; said David, with his eyes
on his plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has grown up to be a raving, tearing,
heart-smashing beauty,&#8221; the lawyer went on, entirely
unmindful of the sudden change in his table-mate.
&#8220;I met her in Indianapolis last summer
when I was there on a business trip. She was
stopping with friends, and she gave me exactly
five minutes by the watch&mdash;which was all the time
she could spare; all the time a dozen other fellows
would let her spare. Somebody told me she
was, or is, going to marry an English title.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is gossip, too,&#8221; said David, still looking
down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so. You can hear all sorts of things
if you&#8217;ll only hold your ears open. Finished your
dinner? If you have, let&#8217;s go and smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, David Vallory came to life again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;No; I can&#8217;t take the time, Bert. I must go
out home and pack my trunk. And I&#8217;m going to
ask a favor of you. Will you be at the train to
see me off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surest thing in the world,&#8221; said the young
lawyer; and after David had gone he sauntered
out to the office-lobby and bought a cigar with
thoughtful deliberation, recalling, now that he
had time to do so, David&#8217;s cryptic remark about
the reasons&mdash;still unexplained&mdash;for and against
his new employment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">V<br />


Gloriana</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DAVID VALLORY had not been strictly
truthful in pleading the journey preparations
as an excuse for leaving Oswald at the dinner-table.
It still wanted three hours of train
time; and, as a matter of fact, his trunk, packed
in Florida for the hurried flight northward, had
not since been unpacked. But on no account
would he have given Oswald the real reason for
his early defection.</p>

<p>That reason began to define itself when, at the
corner beyond the St. Nicholas, he turned to the
left and walked rapidly in a direction precisely
opposite to that in which the home suburb lay.
Down to the railroad yards and across the tracks
he fared, turning presently from the main street
into another which led to a region called &#8220;Judsontown,&#8221;
taking its name from the Judson Foundries
and housing the major portion of Judson&#8217;s
workmen.</p>

<p>At the gate of a cottage a trifle larger and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
more commodious than its neighbors on either
hand, David turned in and walked up the slag-paved
path to the porch. There was a light
turned low in one room of the cottage, but no
other signs of life. But at his approach there
was a rustle of modish skirts on the porch and
a vision appeared; the vision taking the form
of a strikingly handsome young woman, round
limbed, scarlet-lipped, with midnight eyes and
hair. The light from the near-by street lamp
framed her in the porch opening for David as he
swung up the path, and it was a picture to stir
the blood in the veins of an anchorite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gloriana!&#8221; he said, taking both of her hands,
and giving her the name she had given herself as
soon as she was old enough to hate the one her
parents had given her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Davie! you&#8217;ve come at last, have you?&#8221; she
breathed. &#8220;&#8217;Tis long ago I&#8217;d given you up. A
week you&#8217;ve been back, and but for the papers I&#8217;d
never have known it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t scold me, Glo,&#8221; he begged. &#8220;If you
could only know how busy I&#8217;ve been. This is the
first spare minute I&#8217;ve had in the week, honestly.
Where are your father and mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone up-town to the movie. You&#8217;ll
be coming in?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;Just for a little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>She led the way into the cottage, into the room
of the dimmed light. It was exactly as David
remembered it from a time when he had often
been made at home in it; the big-figured red carpet,
the marble-topped center table with the family
Bible, the family photograph album, and a
crocheted mat in the middle for the foot of an
ornate parlor lamp with a crimson shade. Also,
there were the same stiff-backed chairs and the
same sofa upholstered in green rep. In one corner
was the young woman&#8217;s piano. John Fallon
was a foreman in the Judson Foundries and could
well afford to buy his daughter a piano, if he
chose. David sat down on one of the uncomfortable
chairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn up the light and let me see you, Glo,&#8221;
he said, and when she did it: &#8220;Jove! but you
picked the right name for yourself years ago when
we were kiddies! The movie stars have nothing
on you&mdash;not one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flatterer!&#8221; she laughed, and if there were a
faint suggestion of the &#8220;h&#8221; after the &#8220;t&#8217;s&#8221; he did
not mind. Her Irish accent had always seemed
to harmonize perfectly with her rich, &#8220;black-Irish&#8221;
beauty. Then: &#8220;The two years have been
making you into a man, Davie. &#8217;Twas in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
letters when I&#8217;d be reading them. Don&#8217;t be
propping yourself on that chair; come over here
and be yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to sit beside her on the green sofa
and was straightway conscious that he had stepped
within a strange aura. Pointedly and of set purpose
he began to talk of commonplace things;
Middleboro things that had happened during his
absence. But the subtle distraction persisted,
coming like a veil between the thought and the
words until he scarcely knew at times what he
was saying. It was a new experience. What he
had told Oswald was the simple truth; in the old
days he and Judith Fallon had been more like
two boys together than a boy and girl, and the
frank comradeship had carried over from childhood
to manhood and womanhood; or it had up
to now. But now he could see and feel nothing
but her superb physical beauty. Once, as a college
Freshman, he had permitted himself to be
ridiculed into gulping down a drink of whiskey.
&#8220;It was like this,&#8221; he found himself saying aloud,
and the girl beside him laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s come over you, Davie?&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Half the time you&#8217;re talking nonsense&mdash;just nonsense.
But for knowing how you hate it, I might
think you&#8217;d been drinking!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>&#8220;I have,&#8221; he returned soberly, suddenly realizing.
Then: &#8220;Glo, you ought to pick out some
decent young fellow and get married.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed at this, but the black eyes were
hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why would I want to be getting married?&#8221;
she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I did&mdash;two years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were too young then,&#8221; he decided gravely.
&#8220;But now it is time. You&mdash;you&#8217;re a living threat,
as you are. Don&#8217;t you know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what would I be threatening, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The peace of mind of every man who comes
near you. You may not know it, Glo, but you
are the kind of woman for whom men, ever since
the world began, have been throwing everything
worth while into the discard; truth, honor, loyalty&mdash;anything
they had to fling away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you just be finding that out, Davie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you&#8217;re different in some way, Glo; or
else I am. What have you been doing to yourself
in these two years?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What should I be doing? Is a girl to be waiting
always for something that&#8217;s never going to
happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>A cold horror seized him, but he tried to shake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
it off; tried to recall the Gloriana he had grown
up with; a frank, outspoken daughter of the people,
strong to attract, but also strong to resist.
The &#8220;town-side&#8221; boys had jeered him for companying
with John Fallon&#8217;s daughter, a &#8220;factory-side&#8221;
girl, but then, as now, he was wont to go
his own way when he was convinced that the way
was straight and honest. The way had been
straight, he told himself, because the girl was
straight. But now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glo, I meant what I said a few minutes ago;
you ought to get married. Some wise person has
said that all men and women can be divided into
two classes: those who need not marry unless they
choose to, and those who must. You are one of
those who must. It&#8217;s your harbor of safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her low laugh was like an invitation to a sensuous
dance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since when have you turned preacher, Davie?&#8221;
she mocked. &#8220;What&#8217;s got into you to-night?
Put your head down here and let me comb it, the
way I used to when you wore knee stockings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he refused.</p>

<p>She leaned toward him and slipped a round
arm across his shoulders. He reached up and
disengaged it gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said again. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
things like that, Glo. You used to do them once,
and it didn&#8217;t matter. But now you are not the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time her laugh had an edge to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fishes have nothing on you for the cold
blood, Davie. But you&#8217;re like all the men. After
you&#8217;ve made what you like out of a girl, you slap
her in the face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vaguely he understood that she was accusing
him of something.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wishing for nothing but your happiness,
Glo; can&#8217;t you understand that? I&#8217;ve never
wished for anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment. Then she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis to a convent I should have gone, Davie,
instead of to the public&mdash;to run with boys, and
with you. &#8217;Twas you taught me things a girl
shouldn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; said David, still more horror-stricken.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis so. I was a woman grown whilst you
were yet but a boy. You didn&#8217;t know. If your
lady mother had lived she might have told you
more about girls and women. I was loving you,
Davie, long before ever you put a razor to your
face.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time in his life David the man
found it easeful and fitting to curse David the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
boy. &#8220;Warm-hearted,&#8221; he had called Judith in
those other days, and thought no more of it. But
now ... he had been as one who tosses a
careless match aside and passes on, only to turn
and find a forest ablaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what you care to, Glo,&#8221; he said
gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis an old story, I&#8217;m thinking. Whilst I
could be writing to you and knowing you&#8217;d be
coming back from the college the bad heart of
me kept still. But when you went to that place
in Florida the bad heart was empty&mdash;empty for
a man. The man came, Davie; I&#8217;m thinking he
always comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>David had to moisten his lips before he could
say: &#8220;Who was it, Glo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas young Tommy Judson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; said David. The exclamation was half
prayer and half execration. He knew Judson;
all Middleboro knew him as the country town&#8217;s
most faithful imitation of gilded youth and its degeneracy.
After a time he said: &#8220;Somebody
ought to kill him, Glo; I ought to kill him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis little good that would do now. He&#8217;s
gone away, and my father would be getting a
raise in his pay, little knowing why he got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though the windows were open to the summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
night breeze David felt as if he were suffocating.
Springing to his feet he began to pace the narrow
limits of the little sitting-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glo,&#8221; he said chokingly, &#8220;this is the most awful
thing I&#8217;ve ever had to face. I came here to-night
just as I used to come years ago. I meant
to tell you that I had found the girl that I hoped
some day to marry. And now you tell me that I
led you up to the edge and left you where the
next man who came along could push you over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Davie, dear; I&#8217;m not blaming you,&#8221; came
from the green-covered sofa.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am blaming myself.&#8221; He stopped
abruptly before her. &#8220;Let me see your face,
Glory: have you been trying to tell me that I
ought to marry you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She would not look up. &#8220;And you with another
girl in your heart? I&#8217;m not that wicked,
Davie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then at least you must let me talk to you as
we used to talk in the other days; straight from
the shoulder. I was wiser than I knew, a little
while ago, Glory, when I said that your safety
was in marriage. Can&#8217;t you forget and start
afresh? There are plenty of young fellows here
in your part of town who would never ask you
to turn back a single leaf of your life book for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
them; can&#8217;t you marry one of them and make him
a good wife, Glory?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;I can not,&#8221; she said
shortly.</p>

<p>He drew out his watch and held its dial to
the lamp light. It was time to be gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go; I am leaving town to-night, and the
kindest thing I can hope for you is that you&#8217;ll
never see my face again. It doesn&#8217;t help matters
any, but if you have suffered, I shall suffer, too.
You have put a mark on me that I shall carry to
my grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>She got up without a word and walked with
him to the door and down the slag-paved path to
the gate. But at the moment of parting, when he
was again seeking vainly for some word of heartening,
she flung her arms around his neck and
kissed him twice, thrice.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>That&#8217;s</i> why I can&#8217;t marry another man!&#8221; she
panted; and before he could reply she had darted
up the path and into the cottage and had slammed
the door.</p>

<p>It was an older and soberer David who tramped
slowly back through the factory district and
across the railroad tracks to the better lighted
main street of the town. Conscience is definable
only in terms, not of the common, but of the individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
human factor. For the David Vallorys
there are no compromises. He either was, or
was not, Judith Fallon&#8217;s keeper. Had he been
responsible for her development up to a certain
point, the danger point, and had then been blind
enough or thoughtless enough to cast her adrift?
One responsibility he could not shirk: from a
time reaching deeply into their childish years his
influence over her had been stronger than that of
any one else, her parents not excepted. How was
he to know that her yielding to him had been
chiefly sexual, and that unconsciously he had
walked in her path instead of leading her to walk
in his? But even so, was he wholly blameless?</p>

<p>These soul-searching questions kept even step
with him on the way to the hill suburb, and they
made the home leave-taking, a little later, thoughtfully
abstracted. It was his promise to his sister
to come home for Christmas, if he could leave
his work, that reminded him of another responsibility;
and all the way down to the railroad station
he was hoping that Herbert Oswald would
not forget his agreement to be at the train.</p>

<p>Oswald had not forgotten. He was waiting at
the station entrance, and together they walked
out upon the platform. The Chicago express was
bulletined fifteen minutes late, and David was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
thankful for the brief extension of time. There
was a thing to be said to Oswald, and, finding no
way in which to lead up to it, he plunged bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bert, there is something that I want to say&mdash;that
I&#8217;ve got to say&mdash;before I leave. You&#8217;ve been
a mighty good friend to us in this shake-up, and
we shall always owe you a lot more than we can
pay. But I&#8217;m obliged to be a sort of dog in the
manger, right here at the last. I have a sister,
and she is blind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Oswald, and his voice was a bit
thick.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I ought to say; what I want
to say, and can&#8217;t. Lucille isn&#8217;t like other girls;
she can&#8217;t be. And yet she is just as human as
other girls. You mustn&#8217;t go to the house so often,
Bert. If you do, there&#8217;ll be an explosion some
day, and you&#8217;ll never get over being sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly what you mean,&#8221; was
the low-spoken reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall have to tell you in so many
words, brutal as it may sound. With her affliction,
Lucille can&#8217;t marry, and she&mdash;oh, dammit
all&mdash;you know what I mean!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I?&#8221; queried the young lawyer, in the same
thick voice. &#8220;Perhaps I do, and perhaps I don&#8217;t.
You might make it a little plainer, if you care to.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>The belated train had evidently made up some
of its lost time; it was whistling for Middleboro
and the roar of its coming was already filling the
air of the calm summer night with thunderous
murmurings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will make it plainer. The little sister has
taken you on as a friend. But at the same time
you are the only man outside of the family who
has ever taken the trouble to make her life more
bearable. Let it stop at that, Bert; for God&#8217;s
sake, let it stop at that if you don&#8217;t want to break
her heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>The train was in; the conductor was calling
&#8220;All aboard!&#8221; and the Pullman porter had opened
his vestibule. Oswald crossed the platform with
David Vallory in sober silence, but at the hand-gripping
instant he found his tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may go to your job and rest easy, David.
I&#8217;m the last man on God&#8217;s green earth who will
ever do anything to break your sister&#8217;s heart.
Good-by&mdash;and let me hear from you.&#8221;</p>

The Henchman</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE great concrete railroad bridge at Coulee
du Sac was nearing completion, and for
David Vallory, who had spent a summer, an
autumn, and the better part of a winter on the
work, the closing scenes of his brief summer stop-over
in Middleboro had withdrawn into a past
already taking on the characteristics of remoteness.</p>

<p>In their general aspect the bridge-building
weeks and months had been uneventful, or, at
least, unexciting; long working days made short
by a keen interest in his chosen profession; the
good will, early won, of his associates on the engineering
staff; clipped words of approval now
and then&mdash;progress markers, these&mdash;from his
chief, Grimsby, a saturnine man-driver who
cracked the whip oftener than he praised, and who
seemed to enjoy to the fullest extent the confidence
of the boss of bosses, Eben Grillage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Only once in the nine months had David taken
time off; a scant three days in December, two of
them travel-spoiled, and the one in between&mdash;Christmas
Day, it was&mdash;spent with his father and
sister in the Middleboro home. Partly he went
to keep his conditional promise to the blind one;
but underlying the fraternal motive there was
another. Twice during the previous summer he
had written to Judith Fallon, conceiving it to be
no less than a binding duty. There had been no
reply, but the second letter had been returned to
him with the postal legend, &#8220;No such person at
the address given,&#8221; stamped upon the envelope.
His twenty-four-hour Christmas stay in Middleboro
gave him little chance to make inquiries; but
few inquiries were needed. The Fallons had sold
their cottage in Judsontown and moved away,
leaving no word by which they could be traced.
Also, there was a story, not vouched for by David&#8217;s
informant, that there had been trouble of
some sort in the Foundries offices, with a big
Irish foreman smashing his way into Mr. Thomas
Judson&#8217;s private room and assaulting its occupant.</p>

<p>With this new barb to rankle, David went back
to his work at Coulee du Sac saddened and depressed,
and grievously weighted with the sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
of responsibility. He found no difficulty in believing
the story of the explosion in the Judson offices,
and was well able to supply the missing details.
Fallon&#8217;s quarrel was the deadliest a father could
have, and the only wonder was that he had not
committed a murder.</p>

<p>During his nine months&#8217; isolation at Coulee du
Sac, David had met the Vallory benefactor only
a few times; and the benefactor&#8217;s daughter not at
all. For the lack of the social opportunity he was
grateful rather than sorry. In the light of the
Judith Fallon tragedy he was beginning to question
his right to make love to Virginia Grillage,
even if the magic circle could be broken into; or
if not to question the right, to realize the immense
and humiliating barrier which must always exist
between a man with a tragedy in his past and a
woman to whom that past should be as a pane
of glass. And the height of the barrier was not
lessened by the thought that, in the last analysis,
he was culpable only to the extent of having been
bat-blind to the temperamental abysses yawning
for the Judith Fallons. A great love might condone
the blindness, but no pure-minded woman
could ever be made to believe that it was total.</p>

<p>As to Virginia&#8217;s whereabouts during the three-quarters
of a year, David had learned something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
from Eben Grillage, himself. She had spent the
summer with a party of friends in the Rockies&mdash;the
farther Rockies&mdash;touring and resting at a
small resort hotel known only to the elect; she
had spent the shooting season with other friends
in the Adirondacks; and she had gone to Florida
late in the season to escape the Northern winter.</p>

<p>So much for the slightly wider horizons. In
the working-day field, David had been given the
most convincing proof that he had not been merely
placed and forgotten. There had been offerings
of ample opportunity to show what was in him,
with pay-roll advances to fit; and on a March day
when Grimsby, the saturnine chief of construction,
called him into the bridge office for a conference,
he was given fresh assurances that he had
been accepted as a post-graduate member of the
staff.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a rising young man in the profession,
Vallory, and if you keep on as you&#8217;ve begun,
you&#8217;ll come out at the top of the heap,&#8221; was the
complimentary phrase with which the conference
began. &#8220;You are not like most of the young fellows
I&#8217;ve had to hammer into shape; you don&#8217;t
go around firing off the proposition that you know
it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should hope not,&#8221; said David. &#8220;That sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
of thing is the best possible evidence that a man
needs to go to school again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meaning that we&#8217;re all learning all the time?&mdash;that&#8217;s
the idea, exactly,&#8221; said the chief brusquely.
&#8220;Take it in the use&mdash;the modern use&mdash;of reinforced
concrete, for example: we are all children
going to school in that field. What we don&#8217;t
know about it would fill a library.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; David admitted. &#8220;I&#8217;m learning
something new about it every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And just because we are still in the apprentice
stage, I imagine we go pretty wide on the side
of safety,&#8221; Grimsby went on. &#8220;That&#8217;s natural;
we&#8217;re afraid to take our own figures after we&#8217;ve
made them. Now this &#8216;mix&#8217; we&#8217;re using on this
bridge; I&#8217;ll venture the cement content could be
cut down twenty per cent and still leave an ample
margin of safety. What?&#8221; Then, with an abrupt
break: &#8220;Sit down and have a cigar.&#8221;</p>

<p>David found a three-legged stool and nodded
acquiescence to the general postulate that the use
of concrete as a substitute for masonry was as yet
but a babe in arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;The quality of the cement is another disputed
point,&#8221; Grimsby argued. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t the least
doubt in my mind that we are altogether too finical
about that. We&#8217;ve set up a code of theoretical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
standards; such and such a degree of fineness,
such and such a chemical analysis, and all that;
and yet, after the job&#8217;s done, you can&#8217;t tell where
the tested stuff ends and the untested begins.
Isn&#8217;t that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t prove that it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; neither can I. But on this very
point we&#8217;re continually having trouble with the
railroad people, as you know. We may admit
cheerfully that we don&#8217;t know quite all there is
to be known about concrete; but neither do the
railroad company&#8217;s engineers. Their inspectors
on this bridge are a bunch of cranks; that is the
sort of fault-finders that the &#8216;party of the first
part&#8217; always hires to put on the job to watch the
contractors. If we lived up to the specifications
as they&#8217;d like to make us, the Grillage Engineering
Company would come out about a mile deep in the
hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again David Vallory acquiesced. From time
to time he had had troubles of his own with the
watch-dog inspectors representing the railroad
company for which the bridge was being constructed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You younger fellows are fresh from the laboratories,
and you have the latest word in the testing
experiments,&#8221; said Grimsby. &#8220;That&#8217;s why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
I&#8217;ve called you in for a conference. You&#8217;ve been
following the cement tests made in our field laboratory,
haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of them; yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you haven&#8217;t seen anything wrong with
the stuff, so far, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bearded chief nodded. &#8220;That&#8217;s the talk,&#8221;
he said; then he made his frontal attack without
further preface. &#8220;You are loyal to your salt,
aren&#8217;t you, Vallory? If what they tell me about
you and Mr. Grillage is true, you ought to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I am,&#8221; returned the loyalist, a little at a
loss to prefigure what was coming next. Then he
added: &#8220;My family owes Mr. Grillage a greater
debt than we can ever hope to pay, if that is what
you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve understood. Now we can get down
to the nub of the thing. You&#8217;ve heard that the
railroad company has hired a new chief engineer,
haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Esher? Yes; I met him day before yesterday
when he was going over the work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Esher is his name, and he&#8217;s the prize crank
of the lot. He has just thrown out that last shipment
of cement on us; says it doesn&#8217;t test up to
standard in the railroad lab. It&#8217;s all poppy-cock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
of course. Some little-boy chemist on the railroad
pay-roll has made a blunder&mdash;that&#8217;s all there is to
it. Now then; have you been keeping in touch
with your college?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fairly well; yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand in with the professors in the college
cement lab.?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I know them all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good men, are they?&mdash;men whose word you&#8217;d
take in settling a dispute?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In proof tests, you mean? Certainly; I&#8217;d accept
them without question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re up against. This
shipment of cement that I&#8217;m talking about is the
material Shubrick was to have used in the under-water
work on Pier Four. We can&#8217;t afford to
throw it away, and to save it we&#8217;ll have to do a
little juggling; but I want you to satisfy yourself
fully beforehand. Take samples of the cement,
just as it stands, and send them to your college
for analysis. We&#8217;ll keep Shubrick supplied out
of the reserve stock until you get your answer.
Better get the samples off to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now all this was purely routine, and David,
who had thus been honored by the confidence of
his chief, went about it as a part of the day&#8217;s
work. The samples were duly taken and forwarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
to the university, with a personal letter
explaining the reason for the requested analysis.
An unbiased opinion was desired, and the letter-writer
ventured to hope that it might be given
promptly.</p>

<p>In a few days the answer came, and it was entirely
satisfactory. The samples which had been
submitted tested fully up to standard, and the college
authorities were at a loss to understand why
any question should have been raised as to the
quality of the material. David Vallory showed
the letter to Grimsby, and was rewarded by the
hard-featured chief&#8217;s nearest approach to a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the needful bit of juggling,&#8221; was
Grimsby&#8217;s comment. &#8220;The railroad people have
us by the neck because we have to ship everything
in over their line. But we&#8217;ll fool &#8217;em, Vallory.
Luckily, the cement mill isn&#8217;t on their line. We&#8217;ll
send the condemned shipment out to-night, as if
we were returning it to the mill. To-morrow
morning you can slip out on the passenger train
and overtake the freight, say at Little River, on
the F. S. &amp; A., where we are building the power
dam for the paper mill.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory was staring out of the office window
with a small frown wrinkling between his
honest gray eyes. He could forecast what was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
coming, and while the cause seemed to be righteous
enough, the expedient to which he was to resort
bore all the earmarks of crookedness.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you can take a few laborers off the dam&mdash;I&#8217;ll
give you an order to Bullock authorizing
it&mdash;shift the cement into other cars, and fire it
back here. When it comes in, it&#8217;ll figure as a new
shipment, and you&#8217;ll have to doctor the railroad
way-bills a bit to make them fit.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the first time in his working experience
that David had been asked to carry out a piece of
deliberate trickery, though there had been other
occasions when he had helped to throw dust into
the eyes of the too-critical railroad inspectors.
Quite naturally, his point of view in these smaller
deceptions had been that of the men who figured
with him as Eben Grillage&#8217;s paid henchmen; but
this cement &#8220;juggling,&#8221; as Grimsby had baldly
named it, had all the characteristics of a crime.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a rotten shame that we have to get down
to such methods!&#8221; he protested. &#8220;Let me go to
Mr. Esher with the result of these university tests
and Professor Luthe&#8217;s letter. Taking them together
they ought to convince him that we&#8217;re not
trying to put a spoiled batch of cement across on
him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Grimsby&#8217;s smile was too well guarded to betray
his real meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Esher would turn you down cold. It&#8217;s his
business to stand by his own laboratory, of course,
and he&#8217;ll do it. I didn&#8217;t ask you to get this college
analysis with any hope of convincing Esher
with it; I merely wanted you to be satisfied in
your own mind. You see what we&#8217;re up against.
If we have to throw away that shipment of Portland,
it will mean a good chunk of loss for the
Grillage Engineering Company. You said you
owed the big boss something; now&#8217;s the time to
prove that you weren&#8217;t talking through your hat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, David stifled his qualms;
and the next day he carried out his instructions
faithfully and to the letter. The condemned material
was overhauled at Little River and was
shunted into the Engineering Company&#8217;s own construction
yard at the dam. Here it was shifted
to other cars by Bullock&#8217;s laborers, and the juggling
process was brought into play. To the
F. S. &amp; A. agent at Little River, David merely
stated a fact. He was shipping three car-loads
of cement from the company&#8217;s yard at the dam
to the bridge at Coulee du Sac. Would the agent
way-bill them accordingly?</p>

<p>&#8220;Ship cement in one day and out the next, do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
you?&#8221; grinned the railroad man. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I see
the yard crew shoving these three cars over to
the dam yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These are not the same cars,&#8221; said David, and
he produced the yard boss&#8217;s memorandum to
prove it.</p>

<p>The half-truth, which was wholly an untruth
so far as the inner fact was concerned, succeeded.
The cars were billed, and in due course they
reached Coulee du Sac as a new shipment. Just
what was to be gained by the juggling, when the
railroad inspectors would be certain to sample the
cement and test it, with probably the same results
as those they had reached before, was not very
clear to David Vallory. But one night, a little
farther along, he was given a shock of enlightenment.</p>

<p>The shock was administered by his bunk-shack
mate, the engineer in charge of the under-water
work in the caissons; Shubrick by name, and by
training a man who had grown accustomed to
many shifts and tricks in that branch of engineering
which is fullest of fatalities. To Shubrick
David Vallory was freeing his mind on the general
subject of over-critical inspection.</p>

<p>&#8220;These railroad watchers are getting on my
nerves more and more, all the time!&#8221; he complained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
&#8220;They act as if they think we are a
bunch of crooks, needing only half a chance to
scamp this job so that it will fall into the river
with the first train that passes over it. Do they
worry you on the under-water work as much as
they do us on the concreting?&#8221;</p>

<p>Shubrick grinned ferociously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d shut off the air and drown a few of them
if they did. Just the same, David, they&#8217;re onto
their job all right. You needn&#8217;t make any mistake
about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that as if you thought we needed
watching. Do you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>This time Shubrick&#8217;s grin took a sardonic twist.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you are a few years older, you&#8217;ll know
a heap more, David. Why, good Lord, man!
are you nourishing the idea that this contracting
company is doing business on a philanthropic
basis?&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory shook his head. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have
to diagram it for me, I guess. We may not be
any too honest; I&#8217;ve seen some things done that
I&#8217;ve wished we didn&#8217;t have to do. But that isn&#8217;t
an admission that we&#8217;re a gang of thieves, to be
watched and harried from one day&#8217;s end to another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fight,&#8221; said the older man cynically.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
&#8220;The other fellows tie us up with a lot of specifications
that they know perfectly well would ruin
us if we should live up to them; and, on our side,
we live up to just as few of them as the law will
allow. The honor system may work in college,
but it doesn&#8217;t get by to any marked extent in business.
As far as that goes, you, yourself, are not
as innocent as you look, David. You worked that
little cement juggle the other day to the queen&#8217;s
taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard about that?&#8221; said David, and it
was a mark of the short distance he had traveled
on the road to equivocation that he flushed when
he said it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody knows about it&mdash;everybody but
the railroad people. You played it mighty fine.
What&#8217;s puzzling me is the railroad way-bill part
of it. How on top of earth did you contrive to
get those way-bills doctored on the F. S. &amp; A. at
Little River? Did you buy the agent?&#8221;</p>

<p>The flush deepened under David Vallory&#8217;s
eyes. The misleading explanation he had made
to induce the railroad agent to bill the condemned
cement as a mill shipment to be transferred from
the work on the dam to that on the Coulee du Sac
bridge was the least defensible part of the transaction,
or so it seemed to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;The less said about that part of it will be the
soonest mended,&#8221; he returned gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it was a neat little trick all the way
round,&#8221; the under-water boss commented. &#8220;If
Congdon hadn&#8217;t fallen down in the first place, we
wouldn&#8217;t have had to work it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was new ground to David Vallory and he
said as much. &#8220;What did Congdon have to do
with it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Shubrick relighted his pipe, and after a puff or
two: &#8220;Do you mean to tell me that you don&#8217;t
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I knew, I wouldn&#8217;t ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the under-water engineer sucked slowly
at his pipe. &#8220;There is one of two things, David,&#8221;
he remarked, after the pause: &#8220;you are either a
good bit deeper than I&#8217;ve been giving you credit
for being&mdash;or else you&#8217;re too innocent to be running
loose without a guardian. Didn&#8217;t Grimsby
tell you how it all got balled up in the beginning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me that some railroad chemist had
blundered in making the tests.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shubrick&#8217;s laugh was soundless. &#8220;It was our
man Congdon who did the blundering. After he
had made the tests in our own lab., he was ass
enough not to see to it that the railroad chemist
didn&#8217;t get a whack at the stuff.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>&#8220;Are you trying to tell me that the cement
wasn&#8217;t up to standard?&#8221; demanded Grimsby&#8217;s
accessory.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you need to be told. It&#8217;s a &#8216;second,&#8217; all
right enough; it sets unevenly, and is otherwise
off color; but nobody will ever know the difference
after it&#8217;s in place in the bottom of the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the air of the small bunk shack
became stifling and David Vallory got up and
went to stand in the doorway. When he turned
back to Shubrick it was to say: &#8220;Then the whole
thing was a frame-up, was it?&mdash;to enable us to
work off a cheaper grade of Portland in a place
where it couldn&#8217;t show up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it was. We have to play even when
we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I had that shipment analyzed myself. I
sent samples of it to the university.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you took your samples from the wrong
sacks, that&#8217;s all. I&#8217;m using the stuff in the caisson,
and I guess I know what I&#8217;m talking about. It&#8217;s
punk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is so, why haven&#8217;t the railroad people
found it out in a second test?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy. This time Congdon was right
on the job and saw to it that they got the proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
kind of samples. You needn&#8217;t look so horrified;
the bridge isn&#8217;t going to tumble down.&#8221;</p>

<p>But more important things than bridges were
tumbling down in David Vallory&#8217;s heart and mind
at that moment. When a young man has grown
up in an ethical atmosphere the first broad step
toward the unethical is apt to be subversive of a
good many preconceived ideas and standards.
After a time he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shubrick, the frame-up wasn&#8217;t altogether on
the railroad people. Part of it was on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy, too,&#8221; said the older man. &#8220;Grimsby
was merely trying to provide you with a good,
stout <i>alibi</i>; to leave you a nice, respectable hole
to crawl out of in case there should be any future
to the thing. But if you&#8217;re really stirred up about
it, you are foolish. Things like that are done
every day. We are fighting for our own hand.
The Golden Rule is pretty to look at, but it doesn&#8217;t
hold water in business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking the ground that we are dealing
with a condition and not with principles of right
and wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely. A man has got to be loyal to something,
Vallory: I&#8217;m loyal to my bread and butter;
so, too, in the long run, are you, and ninety-nine
other men out of a hundred. Possibly it digs a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
little deeper with you. Haven&#8217;t I heard you say
that you&#8217;d willingly go a mile or so out of your
way where Mr. Grillage&#8217;s interests are concerned?&mdash;that
it was up to you to take long shifts or hard
ones, or anything else that came up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is, then. No man living has ever
been able to draw the line absolute between ethical
right and wrong and lay it down as a mathematical
axiom. I&#8217;ll put it up to you. If you are
a fanatical crank your duty is plain. You know
the inside of this cement deal, and you can show
it up if you feel like it and make it cost the Grillage
Engineering Company a pot of money. But
you are not going to do any such asinine and
ungrateful thing&mdash;you know you&#8217;re not. What
you&#8217;ll do will be to tell yourself that the particular
grade of Portland used is strictly a matter of
opinion between our staff and the railroad&#8217;s, and
let it go at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is altogether improbable that Warner Shubrick
regarded himself as in any sense an <i>advocatus
diaboli</i>; and it might be even farther afield
to suppose that Grimsby had given him a hint to
safeguard the cement fraud by trying to justify it
for his shack-mate. None the less, the seed was
sown and a new point of view was opened for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
David Vallory. Given time to wear itself out,
the natural indignation arising upon the discovery
that he had been used as a tool in Grimsby&#8217;s small
plot became gradually transmuted into something
quite different. Shubrick, in declaring that a man
must be loyal to something, labeled a solvent
which has dissolved much fine gold in the human
laboratory. The transition from loyalty to an
ideal to loyalty to a cause is not so violent as it
may seem. Hence, it need not be written down
as a miracle that, in proportion as the ideals withdrew,
there grew up in David Vallory a blind determination
to be loyal, first, to his salt.</p>

<p>It was in a letter to his father, written at the
end of this same month of March, that the newer
viewpoint got itself set forth in words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what a cramped little circle I&#8217;d
been trotting around in all my life until I came
up here,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;You have to go up against
the real thing in the world fight before you can
get your ideas straightened out, and give things
their proper relative values. The university did
nothing for me in that respect, and the Government
job in Florida was a mere an&aelig;sthetic. But
here I&#8217;m doing a man&#8217;s work, and carrying a
man&#8217;s responsibility. I know you won&#8217;t take it
as a brag if I say to you, Dad, that I&#8217;ve grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
more in the nine months that I&#8217;ve been at Coulee
du Sac than I did in the nine years before that.
For the first time in my experience I&#8217;m beginning
to be able to peep out over the edge of things,
and to grab hold while the grabbing is good. Incidentally,
I&#8217;m learning what it means to be loyal
to a man who has been loyal to me and mine, and
I know it will please you when I say that I&#8217;ve
been able, now and then, to work off a little of
the big debt of gratitude we owe to Mr. Grillage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ordinarily, I should suppose, Mr. Grillage
doesn&#8217;t trouble himself to keep tab on the many
apprentice engineers that he has scattered around
on his numerous contracts, but I&#8217;ve had more than
a hint that he looks my way, now and then. Only
yesterday Grimsby was telling me in his sort of
bitter way that he guessed the big boss was grooming
me for something better than I have now.
While I&#8217;m well enough satisfied with my present
billet, I&#8217;m not married to it so that Mr. Grillage
couldn&#8217;t divorce me. Anyway, here&#8217;s hoping.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was only a short fortnight after the writing
of this home letter that David was summoned to
Chicago by a telegram from the king of the contractors,
and he went with a light heart, half forecasting
another promotion. Also, he was soberly
jubilant over the thought that, by some happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
conjunction of the lucky planets, he might again
be permitted to divide time, at least for one
evening, with Virginia Grillage&#8217;s retinue of court-payers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII<br />


A Reward of Merit</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was after city office hours when David Vallory
reached Chicago, arriving in obedience
to the telegram from headquarters, and he was
preparing to go to a hotel for the night when a
brisk young fellow in livery singled him out to
ask his name and to tell him that Mr. Grillage&#8217;s
car had been sent for him. In the waiting automobile,
to his unbounded surprise and delight, he
found Miss Virginia. The lapse of something
over a year had only made her more ravishingly
beautiful in David&#8217;s eyes, and his welcome was
all that he could ask&mdash;and more.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to feel highly honored,&#8221; she said,
making room for him in the limousine. &#8220;I ran
away from a houseful of people to come in town
for you.&#8221; And then, lest he should be too unreasonably
happy: &#8220;It is <i>so</i> good to be reminded
of dear, old, study Middleboro again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to goodness I might remind you of
something besides Middleboro,&#8221; David complained,
laughing; &#8220;of myself, for example, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Palm Beach, or&mdash;well, in fact, almost anything.
Do you realize that it is over a year since we
last met?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, indeed. Also, I realize that you have
never, by any chance, written a line or happened
to come to Chicago at any time when I&#8217;ve been
at home. Or perhaps you&#8217;ve been here and didn&#8217;t
think it worth while to let me know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing like it,&#8221; said David, matching her
mood. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been in the city since your
father sent me to Coulee du Sac, unless you count
the car-changing times when I went home at
Christmas. You don&#8217;t realize that I have become
a workingman since I left the Government
service. I have, and I&#8217;ve had a laudable ambition
to stick to the job and earn my wages honestly.&#8221;
Then, as the car began threading its way
through the traffic to the northward: &#8220;Where are
you taking me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Home, of course; to The Maples.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the houseful of people? I shall disgrace
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No clothes?&#8221; she suggested, with a smile that
made him tingle to his finger-tips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely nothing to wear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How shocking! But never mind; I shall tell
them all that they are lucky not to have you in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
overalls and mining-boots&mdash;or don&#8217;t you wear
mining-boots on bridges? However, you needn&#8217;t
worry; you won&#8217;t have any chance to be social,
unless it&#8217;s at dinner. Father will monopolize
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is he going to do to me; fire me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The limousine had reached the northward lake
drive, and the king&#8217;s daughter pressed the bell-push
for more speed. &#8220;Dinner will be waiting,&#8221;
she explained. Then she answered his question.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a perfectly profound secret, of course, but
I really believe you <i>are</i> going to be &#8216;fired.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a nice, comforting thing to be told&mdash;just
before dinner!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;But my obsequies
are of no special consequence; tell me about
yourself. Is the English lord still hovering upon
the horizon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cumberleigh? What do you know about
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing much; I merely heard last summer
that you were going to marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I do, you shall have a handsomely engraved
invitation to the wedding&mdash;for the sake of
the past-and-gone kiddie times in old Middleboro.
Won&#8217;t that console you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am consoled speechless. Weddings and
funerals always affect me that way, and the Cumberleigh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
occasion will be both, from my point of
view.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were some miles of this light-hearted
foolishness; brief miles, to be sure, since the big
limousine was both powerful and speedy. At the
end of the miles the car turned in past the gate
lodge of a lakeside estate, an establishment princely
in extent, landscaping and architecture; and the
gap which a disparity of worldly possessions digs
between hope and fruition suddenly yawned wide
for David Vallory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the sphynxian silence?&#8221; inquired the
princess of the magnificences, gibing amiably at
David&#8217;s lapse into speechlessness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too much money,&#8221; he returned half playfully,
waving an arm to include the display of the Grillage
fortune. &#8220;I was just wondering what it
means to you, individually.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have often wondered, myself,&#8221; was the half
musing rejoinder. &#8220;Sometimes I think it means
a lot. It grips one that way, now and again. But
there are other times when I&#8217;m simply obliged to
run away from it, just to convince myself that I&#8217;m
not one of the lay figures in the stage-setting.
Can you understand that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her answer gave David another of the ecstatic
little thrills. It was not the first time that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
had let him see that the quick-witted, clear-sighted
girl-child of his boyish adulation had been only
overlaid, and not spoiled, by the lavishnesses.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I understand it perfectly,&#8221; he assured
her. &#8220;Money, in and of itself, is nothing. It is
only a means to an end.&#8221;</p>

<p>The limousine was stopping under the carriage
entrance of the great house and they had but a
moment more of the comradely isolation. It was
the young woman who seized and made use of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will always remember that, David&mdash;and
let it be clean money,&#8221; she said soberly;
and then, with a quick return to the playful mood:
&#8220;Here we are, just in time for dinner. I shall
introduce you to the houseful as my cradle-brother&mdash;may
I?&mdash;and after dinner you may go your
way with father and get yourself properly &#8216;fired.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Drawing pretty heavily upon the simplicities,
David won through the social preliminaries without
calling any marked attention to himself. Miss
Virginia&#8217;s &#8220;houseful&#8221; made an even dozen at the
rather resplendent dinner-table, and the na&iuml;vely
inquisitive young wife of an elderly stock-broker,
who was David&#8217;s elbow companion, and who kept
him busy answering childish questions about his
profession, saved him from particularizing too
curiously as to the others, though he was observant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
enough to note that none of the many competitors
he had had at Palm Beach was among
them. At the table dispersal he found himself
at once in the clutches of the master of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on into my den and we&#8217;ll break away
from all this hullaballoo,&#8221; growled the king of
the man-drivers; and when the coveted privacy
was secured: &#8220;Pull up a chair and smoke. You&#8217;ll
find cigars in that sponge-box, or pipes and tobacco
on the mantel. How did you leave the
bridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are working on the closing span, and two
months more ought to see the rails down and the
trains running over them,&#8221; David reported, settling
himself in a deep chair with one of the long-stemmed
pipes. &#8220;Now that the cold weather is
over, there is nothing to hold us back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lose much concrete in the freezing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; very little. We used your idea of tarpaulin
coverings and a perforated steam-pipe and
saved practically every yard we put in place.
There was some little kicking on the part of the
inspectors, but we got by with nearly all of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted the big man. &#8220;A bunch of
inspectors wouldn&#8217;t be happy if they couldn&#8217;t find
something to kick about! That&#8217;ll do for the
bridge. We&#8217;ll call it a back-number for you and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
pass it up. I&#8217;ve been letting you alone at Coulee
du Sac; wanted to see what you were going to
make of yourself&mdash;what you were made of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I haven&#8217;t disappointed you too badly,&#8221;
David ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t; if you had, you wouldn&#8217;t be here
to-night. Now then; are you ready to tackle
something a good deal bigger than an assistant&#8217;s
job on a concrete bridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tackle anything you give me; though I&#8217;m
not asking you to push me any faster or farther
than the good of the service will warrant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you lose any sleep over that,&#8221; was the
gruff retort. &#8220;You&#8217;ll never get any plums from
me merely because you happen to be Adam Vallory&#8217;s
son. For that matter, the shoe&#8217;s on the
other foot. I&#8217;m thinking about giving you a hard
job&mdash;a damned hard job. What do you know
about the Nevada Short Line new-alignment
project out in the Timanyoni country?&#8221;</p>

<p>David shook his head in token that he knew
little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Practically nothing more than the technical
articles in the engineering journals have told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a right sizable job, and we have the
contract. We had a fellow named Lushing out
there as chief, but I had to let him go.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>&#8220;Incompetent?&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; competent as the very devil. But he
welshed; let himself be bought up by the railroad
company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just plain crooked; gave us the double-cross;
chummed in with the railroad staff; took favors,
and all that. Any time he wanted a special to run
down to Brewster for a night off, he got it&mdash;and
we paid for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having his recent experience in mind, David
Vallory understood perfectly. With a man of
the Lushing type in charge as chief constructing
engineer there would naturally be no cutting of
corners on the hard-and-fast specifications; no
saving of money for the Grillage treasury.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me that plain business loyalty is
one of the things you buy, or ought to buy, with
the salaries you pay,&#8221; was his disposal of the
Lushing case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lushing is a fise-dog, and he has proved it by
going over to the railroad engineering staff as
chief inspector,&#8221; rasped the man-driver. &#8220;What
do you think about that?&mdash;going over to the other
side and carrying with him all the information
that his job with us had given him?&#8221;</p>

<p>David was by this time sufficiently partisan to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
lose sight of the fact that a discharged man might
be excused for taking the first place that might
offer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was unprofessional, to say the least,&#8221; was
his comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was more to it than that, but we needn&#8217;t
go into the contemptible whys and wherefores,&#8221;
Grillage went on, with a portentous frown. &#8220;I
let him out, and for a month or more we&#8217;ve been
rocking along without a chief&mdash;and with a man
against us who knows all the tricks of the trade.
I&#8217;ve called you in to ask if you think you are big
enough to swing the job and hold up our end of the
pole. Grimsby says you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory gasped. It was a tremendous
promotion for a young man less than four years
out of college, and he was wise enough to discount
his lack of experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only an apprentice, as you might say, Mr.
Grillage, and many a man with my equipment, or
more, is still carrying a transit,&#8221; he said, after a
momentary pause for the breath-catching. &#8220;But
I&#8217;m going to leave it with you. If you think I
am equal to it, I can only say that I&#8217;ll do my level
best not to disappoint you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man&#8217;s laugh was like the creaking of a
rusty door-hinge.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re modest, David, and that isn&#8217;t the worst
thing that can happen to a young fellow in his
beginnings. But I&#8217;ve been keeping cases on you,
and I go a good deal on what Grimsby says. He
gives you a good send-off; says you know the engineering
game, and can keep your head and
handle men. The Timanyoni job won&#8217;t ask for
much more, unless it&#8217;s a little of this loyalty you
talk about. If you need an older head, you&#8217;ll
have Plegg, who&#8217;s been first assistant on the job
since it began. Plegg has the age and the experience,
and you can lean on him for everything but
initiative&mdash;which is the one thing he hasn&#8217;t got.
Now we&#8217;ll get down to the lay-out,&#8221; and he took
a huge roll of blue-prints from its case and began
a brittle outlining of the realignment project in the
Hophra Mountains.</p>

<p>David Vallory, still a trifle dazed by the suddenness
and magnitude of the promotion, bent
over the drawings and became a sponge to soak up
the details. In the construction of the Nevada
Short Line over the Hophras in the day of the
great gold discoveries, haste had been the watch-word
of the builders. With the golden lure ahead
to put a premium upon speed, the engineers had
eliminated cuts, fills and tunnels, so far as possible,
and had made the line climb by a series of reversed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
curves and heavy grades to the surmounting of
the obstacle mountain range at Hophra Pass.</p>

<p>Now, since the Short Line had become an integral
part of the far-reaching P. S-W. system, a
campaign of distance-shortening and grade-reducing
had been inaugurated. There were bridges
to be built, hills to be cut through, tunnels to be
driven. Powder Can, a mining town nestling in
the shadow of the mountains, was the center of the
activities, but the work extended for some miles
in either direction from the town, with the heaviest
of the hill-cutting and tunnel-driving climaxing
in the big bore which was to form the needle&#8217;s eye
for the threading of the mountain range.</p>

<p>Again modestly discounting his lack of experience,
David Vallory was doubtful of his ability to
plan and carry out such a vast undertaking from
its inception. But the trail was already broken
for him, and he had only to walk in the technical
footsteps of his predecessors. And with a good
assistant who had been familiar with the work
from the first, this should be comparatively easy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m your man, Mr. Grillage,&#8221; he said, after
the maps and plans had been duly considered.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll lean on Plegg, as you suggest, and give you
the best there is in me. I&#8217;ll say frankly that I
don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m big enough yet to swing a thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
like this as a new proposition. But with the lay-out
all made and the work in progress, I ought to
be able to pick it up and carry it to the finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s up to you,&#8221; said the big man shortly.
&#8220;You may take this set of blue-prints with you and
check yourself into the job on your way to Colorado.
Grimsby says you&#8217;re good for the engineering
end of it, and I&#8217;m taking his word for that.
But there is another angle that you mustn&#8217;t lose
sight of. It is a big job, and there were half a
dozen bidders. We had to cut mighty close to
get in, and any bad breaks on our part are going
to shove the profits over to the other side of the
books and write &#8217;em down in red ink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There mustn&#8217;t be any bad breaks; that&#8217;s all
there is to that part of it,&#8221; said David, with youthful
dogmatism.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk. And more than that, we
must shave all the foolish frills out of the specifications.
You know how that goes, or, if you
don&#8217;t, Matt Grimsby hasn&#8217;t done his duty by you.
On a job like this the railroad engineers would
have us gold-plate every spike we drive, if they
could. You&#8217;ve been in the contracting business
long enough now to know what I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>David made the sign of assent without prejudice
to any of the standards of uprightness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
fair play, the undermining of which he was still
far from suspecting in his own case.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be working for the Grillage Engineering
Company, first, last and all the time,&#8221; he
asserted. &#8220;The company&#8217;s business is my business,
and I haven&#8217;t any other.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, the contractor-king&#8217;s gruffness fell away
from him as if it were a displaced mask.</p>

<p>&#8220;There spoke your father, David, and a better
man never lived. I was only trying you out a
while back when I said that you needn&#8217;t look for
the plums just because you happen to be Adam
Vallory&#8217;s son. After you get a little farther up
the ladder and find that you have to depend on
the man or men lower down, you&#8217;ll be willing to
pay high for a little personal loyalty of the sort
that looks an inch or two beyond the next pay-day.
I&#8217;m putting you right where I&#8217;d put a son
of my own, if I had one, out yonder in the Timanyoni
country, boy&mdash;and for the same reason. I
want to have somebody on the job that I can bank
on and swear by.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the one touch needed to put the fragrant
flower of personal relationship upon the juggler-grown
tree of promotion. David Vallory was
still young enough to take the oath of allegiance
without reservations to any master strong enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
and generous enough to command his loyalty, and
Eben Grillage could have found no surer way to
light the fires of blind, unreckoning fealty.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little less than a year ago, Mr. Grillage,
you loaded me with the heaviest obligation a man
can carry. You are adding to it now by giving
me a boost big enough to make a much older man
light-headed. I&#8217;d be a mighty poor sort of a son
to Dad if I didn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the obligations,&#8221; the master broke
in, with a return to the brittle abruptness. &#8220;There
is an old saying that the quickest way to make an
enemy of a man is to do him a favor. If it isn&#8217;t
working out that way in your case, why, so much
the better. Now you may go back to the dinner
people, if you want to. I&#8217;ve got to dictate a bunch
of letters.&#8221; And the king of the contractors
jabbed his square-ended thumb on a push-button
to summon his secretary.</p>

Out of the Past</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DISMISSED from the presence of the hard-bitted
maker of destinies, David Vallory&mdash;not
being a devotee of bridge&mdash;spent little enough
of what was left of the evening in the manner in
which he most wished to spend it. But at the end
of things, when hope deferred was about to fold
its wings and go to bed, Miss Virginia gave her
place at the second whist table to the elderly broker&#8217;s
juvenile wife, and David had the reward
which comes to those who only stand and wait.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, have you been dishonorably discharged?&#8221;
she asked, after they had passed out
of earshot of the card players.</p>

<p>&#8220;I imagine you know a lot more than I can tell
you about it,&#8221; he bubbled happily. &#8220;I&#8217;m to take
an early train to-morrow morning and vanish, disappear,
fade into the western horizon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sorry&mdash;or glad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both. I&#8217;ve had a promotion so whaling big
that it makes my head swim. But the place of it
is a mighty long jump from Chicago.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t make any use of the nearness of
Chicago while you had it at Coulee du Sac,&#8221; she
cavilled. Then: &#8220;Are you starting west without
going to see your father and sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was with them Christmas, as I told you.
And I have a plan which has been simmering
while I was waiting for you to get tired of the
whist-game. If the living accommodations in
the Timanyoni country are at all possible, I shall
send for Dad and Lucille a little later in the
season.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The accommodations are very good. There
is a small summer-resort hotel with cottages on
the ridge opposite Powder Can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been there?&#8221; David asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once; for a few weeks last summer, or rather
early in the autumn, when the work was just starting.
But won&#8217;t that be a rather violent change
for your father and sister?&mdash;from sleepy old
Middleboro to the heart of the Rockies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly. But there are reasons for believing
that it will be beneficial all around. Dad isn&#8217;t
entirely well. His heart was never in the banking
business to any great extent, but just the same,
the breaking up of all the old routine is hard for
him. A complete change will do him no end of
good.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;You said &#8216;reasons&#8217;, and that is only one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is another. How much do you remember
about my sister, Lucille?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only that she is blind, and perfectly angelic,
and the most delicately beautiful child that ever
breathed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is all those things yet&mdash;only more so. Do
you remember Bert Oswald?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; quite well. He is a lawyer now, isn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even so. Worse than that, he is in love with
Lucille, and&mdash;er&mdash;I&#8217;m very much afraid she is
with him&mdash;entirely without realizing it, you know.
It&#8217;s a pitiful misfortune for both of them. Of
course, Lucille can never marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say &#8216;of course&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With her affliction? She doesn&#8217;t dream of such
a thing! Herbert has been very decent about it.
I put him on his guard last summer before I left
Middleboro, and he hasn&#8217;t spoken&mdash;yet. But a
day may come when he will speak, and then, as I
have told him, there will be trouble and a lot of
needless wretchedness. That&#8217;s why I want to get
Dad and sister away from Middleboro. If they
are not where Bert can drop in every few minutes,
it will be different.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a time the daughter of profitable contracts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
did not comment on the plan, but when she did
there was a touch of her father&#8217;s shrewd directness
in her manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the most frightfully cold-blooded person
I&#8217;ve ever met,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;If you had
ever been in love yourself you wouldn&#8217;t talk so
calmly about separating these two. What if Lucille
is blind? There have been blind wives, and
blind husbands, for that matter, since the beginning
of time. You&#8217;re hard-hearted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said David; &#8220;I am only trying to be the
right kind of a brother&mdash;as I have tried to be ever
since that black day years ago when old Doctor
Brown told us that the little sister would never see
again. And your argument falls down at the
other end, too. You say, if I had ever been in
love myself.... That has already happened to
me, Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her laugh was deliciously care free. &#8220;And you
have never told me!&#8221; she mocked. &#8220;Does she
live in Middleboro?&mdash;or maybe it&#8217;s Florida. Or
have you broken all the traditions by keeping faith
with a college widow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she doesn&#8217;t live in Middleboro or in Florida,
and I am very certain she has never been a
college widow. It&#8217;s only a pipe-dream for me as
yet, but some day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>&#8220;Some day she will grow tired of waiting and
marry somebody else,&#8221; was the brisk retort. &#8220;Is
she pretty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; that isn&#8217;t the word at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beautiful, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So beautiful that I can&#8217;t be with her without
going fairly dotty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she laughed derisively.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to have all the symptoms, and really
I didn&#8217;t believe it of you, David. You have always
seemed so solid and sensible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am both,&#8221; he boasted gravely. Then in a
quick shift to safer ground: &#8220;You told me once
that you enjoyed going out on the work with your
father&mdash;is there any chance that you may come
to the Timanyoni this summer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe. I liked it when I was out there last
year&mdash;for some things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And for some other things you didn&#8217;t? What
were they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not talk about them. But there
was one thing.... Do you know anything about
Powder Can?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Less than nothing beyond what your father
has just told me. He says it&#8217;s a mining-camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is worse than the usual mining-camp, or it
was when I saw it. It is the only place where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
workmen can go to spend their pay, and you know
what that would mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can visualize it pretty well; whiskey, dance-halls
and gambling dens, and all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. We saw little of it at the hotel; the Inn
is quite a distance from the town and on the other
side of the river. But once I went there with&mdash;with
a man. I didn&#8217;t know where he was taking
me&mdash;or us; there was a party of us from the hotel,
you know; slummers, you&#8217;d call us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the man, but he ought to have
been murdered,&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something like that, yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But
that wasn&#8217;t what I meant to speak about particularly.
One of the places where he tried to take
us&mdash;only we wouldn&#8217;t go in&mdash;was a dance-hall.
There was a girl at the piano; I could see her
from where I was standing on the sidewalk. She
was beautiful, David, and it made my heart ache
to see her in such a place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should never have seen her,&#8221; said David
hotly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to imagine the kind of
man who would take you to such a place as that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t worth imagining,&#8221; she asserted
quietly. &#8220;But I was speaking of the girl. She
was playing for the dancers, you know, and just
in the little minute that we were standing there, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
big quarryman broke out of the circle and&mdash;and
put his arm around her neck. It was horrible.
She fought like a tiger, but the man was too strong
for her. He struck her ... with his fist.&#8221;</p>

<p>David shook his head. &#8220;Why are you making
yourself remember all this? It&#8217;s just painful, and
it can&#8217;t do any good. It was a shame that you
had to see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is foolish,&#8221; she reproved gravely. &#8220;We
are not living in the Victorian age, David, and
the shame wasn&#8217;t in my seeing it. The dancing
stopped, of course, and the men in our party, or
some of them, rushed in and interfered. The girl
was carried out; the brute&#8217;s blow had knocked her
senseless. She was taken home and we did what
we could for her. The next day I went to see
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was like you, Virginia, only&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t say that you ought not to have done
it; you know best about that; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to go, David. There was a&mdash;a sort of
obligation, you know. She was one of our Middleboro
girls. I didn&#8217;t know her, but I remembered
seeing her as a little thing. Perhaps you
knew her; her name is Judith Fallon.&#8221;</p>

<p>If a bomb had been suddenly exploded under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
David Vallory he could scarcely have been more
completely unnerved and shaken. They were sitting
in a window alcove a little apart from the
bridge players, and the looped-back curtains
dimmed the lights in some measure&mdash;for which he
was thankful. But Virginia Grillage seemed not
to have noticed his gasping start at the mention of
Judith&#8217;s name, and she went on soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I say, I had to go, and I found that things
were not quite as bad as they seemed&mdash;though
they were bad enough. The girl had lately lost
her mother, and she was keeping house in a little
three-room shack for her father, a mechanic in
the Murtrie Mine. I didn&#8217;t see him, of course,
but from what Judith said I gathered that he had
taken to drinking after the mother&#8217;s death. You&#8217;d
say he must have gotten pretty low, to let his
daughter earn money by playing the piano in a
dance-hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>David recalled the John Fallon he had known;
a rough-cast, unlettered man, but a skilled mechanic
and thrifty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew him well,&#8221; he said; adding: &#8220;There
was some trouble&mdash;family trouble, I think&mdash;before
the Fallons moved away from Middleboro. I
heard something about it when I was home for
Christmas.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s the conditions in Powder Can,&#8221; she
averred; &#8220;and for those the new work on the railroad
is responsible&mdash;an army of workmen with
money to throw away. Judith, and probably her
father, are neither better nor worse than other
people with their point of view. It isn&#8217;t fair to
such people to permit the conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I quite agree with you,&#8221; he rejoined hastily.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how much I shall be able to do, as
chief of construction, but from what you have been
telling me it is evident that this plague spot right
at our doors ought to be cleaned up with a strong
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does that mean that you are going to reform
things out there, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever needs reforming, yes; if I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you might say that and mean it, knowing
all that it implies,&#8221; she returned, half musingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it imply?&#8221;</p>

<p>The card players were rising, and there was a
sputtering rapid-fire of motors in the driveway.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;is something you must
find out for yourself, if you can&mdash;and will. Now
I must go. People will want to be telling me what
an exquisite time they&#8217;ve had. You say you are
leaving early in the morning? Then I will say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
good-night and good-by. The hall man will show
you your room. Give my love to your father and
sister when you write, and don&#8217;t, for pity&#8217;s sake,
drag them away out yonder to the ragged edge of
nowhere!&#8221;</p>

Silas Plegg</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">POWDER GAP, a hill-studded basin where
the Powder River, leaping down from the
high watershed of the upper range, gathers itself
for the swift rush to its emptying into the Timanyoni
forty miles away, lies like a half-closed hand
in a gorge of the Hophras, with the upturned
fingers and thumb postulating the surrounding
majesties of mountain peaks, and the forested hills
and ridges figuring as the callouses in the palm.</p>

<p>At the foot of one of the callouses lies the
mining hamlet of Powder Can; once, in the day of
the early mineral discoveries, a plangent, strident
nucleus of excitement, but&mdash;in the phrase of its
oldest inhabitant&mdash;a &#8220;has-been&#8221; at the time of
David Vallory&#8217;s advent, with a few deep shafts
and winding drifts out of which day-laborers, unenthusiastic
successors of the early discoverers and
plungers, winched or wheeled a few monthly car-loads
of low-grade ore.</p>

<p>In some measure the Nevada Short Line&#8217;s track-changing
activities had brought a return of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
plangencies. Scattered construction camps with
their armies of workmen dotted the basin above
and below the mining town, and once more saloons
and dance-halls and gambling places sprang up
and did a thriving business on real pay-roll money.
Eben Grillage&#8217;s attitude toward these absorbents
of the money he paid out for labor had ever been
that of the closed eye. To all appeals for the
betterment of conditions in the humanitarian field
he had a stereotyped reply: &#8220;The Grillage Engineering
Company is strictly an industrial proposition.
It does not undertake to say how its employees
shall spend their time or their money when
they are off duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the summit of a ridge diagonally opposite
Powder Can the prospective millionaires of the
mining-camp had, in the day of magnificent expectations,
laid out a suburb for the future city, and
in token of their faith in the future had built a
log-house hotel with appropriate cottages. For
some years after the collapse of the mining boom
the hotel had remained closed; but with the nearer
approach of the railroad it was reopened, with a
few families from Brewster as the groundwork
of the guest structure, and some small sprinkling
of tourists to come and go during the season.</p>

<p>For a month or more after his arrival in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Hophra basin, David Vallory saw little of Powder
Can the town, and still less of the log-built inn on
the top of the adjacent ridge. New to every phase
of the track-changing project, he had scant time
even for eating and sleeping. At a dozen different
points on the new location the work was driving
at top speed; here and there bridges in process
of construction over the swift mountain stream;
numerous hill cuttings where great steam-shovels
clashed their gears and chains from shift to shift
throughout the twenty-four-hour days; prodigious
fills growing foot by foot with the dumped spoil
from the cuttings; and, last but by no means least,
the projected tunnel under Powder Pass which was
inching its way from both sides of the mountain in
gigantic worm-gnawings through the granite.</p>

<p>During this strenuous preliminary period in
which he was striving to gather the multiplicity of
working threads into his hands, David lived in
the bunk trains and mess tents, getting in touch
with the various units of the laboring armies, and
absorbing the details as a thirsty dog laps water.
To his great satisfaction he found his staff largely
composed of young men eager to make a record;
eager, also, to pledge fealty to a chief who was
himself young enough to be still in the process of
winning his spurs. Plegg, the first assistant, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the single exception to the youth of the staff. He
was a man of middle age, and at their first meeting
David was struck with a vague sense of familiarity;
an elusive impression that he had somewhere
in the memory files a picture of the senior
assistant&#8217;s weathered face, with its clipped beard,
shrewd eyes and thin-lipped mouth about which a
half-cynical smile played so often and so easily as
to become almost an added feature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have we ever met before, Mr. Plegg?&#8221; he
had asked, at that first meeting; and the mildly
sardonic smile had immediately fallen into broader
lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once, Mr. Vallory; on a fine June morning
nearly a year ago. It was in a Pullman sleeper,
back in God&#8217;s country; and, if I recall it correctly,
I told you you would go far if you were not too
good. You are fulfilling my little prophecy very
handsomely; and incidentally we are both proving
the truth of that old bromide about the extreme
narrowness of the world we live in. I&#8217;m glad to
have you for my chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Silas Plegg who did the most toward
helping the new chief in the absorbing of the details,
and David Vallory early acquired a great
and growing respect for the technical gifts of his
first assistant. The organization of the engineering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
staff, and of the rank and file, was fairly geniusful,
the hand of a master being evident in every
disposition of the huge working army. David
weighed and measured, studied and observed; and
at the end of the preliminary month was ready to
give credit where credit was due.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plegg, you are too good an engineer to be anybody&#8217;s
assistant,&#8221; he said, one evening after they
had finished a round of the night-shift activities
and had returned to the cramped quarters of the
small bunk car which they shared together. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t Mr. Grillage give you this job after Lushing
quit?&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg&#8217;s smile was grim.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were really as cynical as you think I am,
I might hint that possibly Mr. Grillage had a
young man in his eye whom he wished to give a
shove up the ladder. But I&#8217;ll stand it upon another
leg. Mr. Eben Grillage is an excellent
judge of men; and he knows me of old.&#8221;</p>

<p>David shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That ought to be your very best recommendation.
What have you ever done to make him pass
you up in the promotion scheme?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was something that my ancestors did&mdash;if
you believe in heredity. They gave me the qualities
of a good follower and neglected to include<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the saving moiety of leadership&mdash;that&#8217;s all. But
speaking of Mr. Grillage; did you know he is on
his way out here?&#8221;</p>

<p>David had not known it and he said so. &#8220;How
did you hear?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such news always travels ahead of a man of
Mr. Grillage&#8217;s importance in the scheme of things.
I heard it from one of the clerks at the Alta Vista
Inn. The big boss has wired ahead for a double
suite.&#8221;</p>

<p>The double suite could mean only one thing, and
David&#8217;s pulses quickened after the most approved
fashion of pulses in such case made and provided.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is bringing Miss Virginia with him?&#8221; he
queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most likely. She chums with her father a
good bit&mdash;when she isn&#8217;t too busy otherwise. Ever
meet her?&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory admitted the fact affirmative but
did not dilate upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a pretty good little engineer, herself,&#8221;
Plegg went on. &#8220;She was out here last fall, and
it was whispered around at the Inn that Lushing
had the colossal nerve to make love to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that wasn&#8217;t the reason why he was
dropped?&#8221; said David, willing to learn something
more of the rise and fall of his predecessor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;Nobody knows; but it may have had some
bearing. Mr. Grillage never had much use for
Lushing as a man, but he was&mdash;and is&mdash;a cracking
good organizer; a man who could squeeze a profit
out of a job on a bid that had driven every other
contractor out of the field. It was a fairly open
secret around here last fall that Miss Virginia
turned him down hard; and after that he began
to sell us out to the railroad company. Basing
the notion upon the Inn gossip about him and Miss
Virginia, our fellows were not slow to charge his
treason to pure vindictiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory was wiser now than he had been
when he began as a working assistant on the Coulee
du Sac bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he have to sell, Plegg?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Plegg closed one eye and his habitual smile
showed his strong, even teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little tricks of the trade,&#8221; he answered
obliquely. &#8220;You are the chief on the job now,
and if you don&#8217;t know what they are, you can say
that you don&#8217;t, and swear to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that we are not giving the railroad
company a square deal?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Plegg&#8217;s reply took the diagonal instead
of the direct line.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are giving them all they are paying us for.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Of course, they are not satisfied; no party of the
first part in a contracting deal ever is. And now
that Lushing has gone over to their side of the
fence, we&#8217;ve had trouble on top of trouble. If
you&#8217;ll take a word of advice from an older man
and a subordinate, you&#8217;ll stay out of it. In fact,
I think that is what Mr. Grillage expects you
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the moment, David did not attach any special
importance to this remark of Plegg&#8217;s about Mr.
Grillage&#8217;s attitude. But if he could have turned
the leaves of the book of days backward to the
night of his stay at the lakeside mansion of the
lavishnesses, the explanation would have synchronized
itself quite accurately with his retreat to his
room in The Maples and the departure of the last
of the bridge-playing dinner guests.</p>

<p>At the door-closing upon the final couple, Miss
Virginia had sought her father in his den. By
this time the private secretary had been dismissed
and the king of the contractors was alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Vinnie, girl!&#8221; he rumbled. &#8220;Come to
tell the old daddy good-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Partly,&#8221; was the crisp rejoinder. &#8220;But mostly
it&#8217;s about David. You have decided to send him
to the Timanyoni, in spite of my little protest?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eben Grillage&#8217;s laugh resembled nothing so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
much as the rasping of circular saws, but he meant
it to be good-natured. He could hold no other
attitude toward the daughter whom David, in his
talk with his father, had characterized as the apple
of his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;You women are too much for me, Vinnie.
You like David, and you want to see him get
ahead. But when I hunt out a good place for him,
you suddenly take a notion that you don&#8217;t want
him to have it. What&#8217;s the particular reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at this point that the young woman had
taken a chair at the opposite side of the broad
working table where she sat facing her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I thought I could make you understand,&#8221;
she said, half musingly. And then: &#8220;I do like
David and I respect him. It seems such a needless
pity to spoil him, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by spoiling him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know perfectly well what I mean. He
has his own ideas of uprightness and common honesty&mdash;or
he did have them before he went to work
for the company&mdash;and they are the right ideas.
How long is he going to be able to keep them if
you put him in charge of the work in Powder Gap
and make him responsible for all the crooked
things that are being done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a pretty hard word to fling at your old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
daddy, Vinnie. Has it reached the point where
you can call your father&#8217;s business crooked? If
I had known that the colleges were going to put
that kind of a fad into your head, they wouldn&#8217;t
have got any of my money&mdash;not in a thousand
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook the head in question despairingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How often must I say that it wasn&#8217;t the colleges.
It is in the air. A new era is dawning, if
we only had eyes to see and ears to hear. As a
people we had forgotten that there was such a
thing as an American conscience. Some of us are
remembering now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some few impractical college professors and
fanatics are making mountains out of molehills!&#8221;
was the grumbling retort. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t be foolish,
Vinnie, girl. Competition is the life of trade,
and competition means a fight. If we don&#8217;t do
the other fellow&mdash;within reasonable business
limits, of course&mdash;he&#8217;ll do us, and we&#8217;ll all go to
the poor-farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been over all that before, many
times,&#8221; said the young woman, with a touch of
weariness in her tone. &#8220;I don&#8217;t ever hope to make
you see it as I do&mdash;as I can&#8217;t help seeing it&mdash;but
I shouldn&#8217;t be your daughter and a Grillage if I
refused to make a fight for David.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>For some little time the grizzled giant in the
wide-armed chair made no reply. He had picked
up a paper-knife and was absently passing it
through his thick, square-ended fingers in the manner
of one testing the keenness of an edged tool.
Finally he said: &#8220;Is David the man, Vinnie?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not affect to misunderstand him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any &#8216;the man&#8217; yet. I like the
grown-up David, partly because he has kept the
promise of the little-boy David, and partly because
he is so different from the others. He needs an
alert, wide-awake sister to look after him much
more than he does a wife. Besides, he&#8217;s already
in love with&mdash;some girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father&#8217;s chuckle was good-naturedly derisive.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s sheer girl-talk&mdash;the sisterly business,
and the other&mdash;and it isn&#8217;t like you to try to throw
dust, Vinnie. We&#8217;ll clear the air in that quarter,
once for all. I haven&#8217;t any objections. David&#8217;s
a good boy; a good son of a mighty good father.
If he inherits some of Adam&#8217;s finicky notions, I
suppose that can&#8217;t be helped. He&#8217;s as poor as
Job&#8217;s turkey, but I can make him a rich man for
you if you don&#8217;t insist on chucking too many stones
in front of the wheels. You can&#8217;t marry a poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
man, you know; you haven&#8217;t been brought up
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was just here that the daughter of profitable
contracts showed her first touch of warmth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have some other reason for sending
David to the work in Powder Gap,&#8221; she said
accusingly. &#8220;You know you have always made it
your boast that you never mix business and sentiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe this was one time when business and
sentiment happened to trot in double harness&#8221;&mdash;with
a grim smile. &#8220;If you&#8217;re figuring on being
a contracting engineer&#8217;s wife some time, you&#8217;ll
have to throw away some of your highbrow college
notions and get down to the practical things.
One way and another, we&#8217;ve been getting in Dutch
with the railroad people out yonder on the Short
Line. You know that, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know there has been quarreling almost from
the beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Ford, the president of the P. S-W. system,
contends that we have a set of crooks in
charge out there&mdash;this in spite of the fact that
some understrapper of his on the ground has hired
Lushing, the biggest of the crooks. Ford knows
David&#8217;s family, and the straight-backed honest old
stock there is in the Vallorys. I&#8217;m killing two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
birds with one cartridge. With Adam Vallory&#8217;s
boy in charge for us at Powder Gap, Ford may
rest easier, and maybe he&#8217;ll make it a little easier
for us. And, by giving David his boost, I&#8217;m fixing
it so you won&#8217;t have to marry a poor man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not talking about marrying; I&#8217;m talking
about the soul of a man,&#8221; was the quick retort. &#8220;It
is in your hands to keep David Vallory true to his
ideals, or to make him like other men who have
one conscience for their personal relations and another
for business. David is more loyal to you
than your own son would be, if you had one; after
what you did for his father last summer he would
go through fire and water for you. It isn&#8217;t right
or just for you to use so fine a thing as his gratitude
and make it the means of his undoing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the big man in the opposite chair fell
silent. When he spoke again it was to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all wrong, Vinnie, girl; wrong and a
little bit wrought up. You are carried away by
your own impossible notions of the golden-rule in
business, and all that&mdash;things that you know about
only by hearsay. You won&#8217;t take it amiss if the
old daddy has his notions, too, will you? Just
the same, we&#8217;re chums, little girl, and we won&#8217;t
fight about a little thing like that. I&#8217;ll see to it
that David doesn&#8217;t have to stick his fingers into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
the tar-barrel, if that&#8217;s what you want. Now run
along to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The upshot of this heart-to-heart talk between
the father and daughter had been a letter to Silas
Plegg, which followed David Vallory so promptly
in his westward flight as to be in the first assistant&#8217;s
hands when he made his introductory round over
the big job with the new chief. It was a letter to
be read, remembered, and burned; but if David
Vallory could have seen it, it would have explained
Plegg&#8217;s attitude, and many other things which
grew more and more puzzling as time went on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">X<br />


The Miry Clay</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HAVING himself so recently made the journey
from Chicago to the Timanyoni, David
Vallory knew that he could count upon at least
two clear days in which to gather up the loose ends
and otherwise to prepare his huge working machine
for a critical inspection by the president of
the company. To that end he called a conference
of the members of his staff and applied the spur.
The big boss was coming, and it was up to them
to show him the machine in perfect working order.
If there were any loose ends, now was the time to
tie them in.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing that I&#8217;d like to see
changed,&#8221; said Crawford, the grading expert who
had charge of the line building on the lower end
of the cut-off; &#8220;that is this crazy practice of paying
off every two weeks instead of once a month. I
count on at least a ten per cent reduction in my
gangs for two or three days after every second
Saturday&mdash;which is about the length of time it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
takes the high-rollers to get rid of their money in
the Powder Can dives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leaks of that kind are precisely what we are
trying to find and stop,&#8221; the new chief broke in.
&#8220;Any suggestions?&#8221;</p>

<p>There were several made by different members
of the staff, but they were all variations upon the
same theme, namely, some method by which the
too-frequent pay-days might be abolished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid the twice-a-month basis will have to
stand,&#8221; was David Vallory&#8217;s decision. &#8220;I talked
that matter out with Mr. Grillage before I left
Chicago. He is opposed to the fortnightly pay-day,
but he has been forced to establish it on all
of his contracts because other companies have
adopted it, and if we don&#8217;t keep step we lose our
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zat Powder Can&mdash;she is one blot on zee face
of zee eart&#8217;!&#8221; spat out Regnier, the fiery little
French-Canadian engineer who was handling the
gangs in the rock cuttings.</p>

<p>David Vallory nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;m new to this country,&#8221;
he admitted. &#8220;Are there no laws by which
these man-trappers can be put out of business?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Plegg who made answer to this.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sheriff&#8217;s writs don&#8217;t run this far from the
nearest court-house. What is everybody&#8217;s business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
is nobody&#8217;s business. Besides, the man-traps
and the construction camps have gone hand-in-hand
ever since the beginning of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no reason why they should continue
to do so to the end of time,&#8221; David cut in. &#8220;If
the Powder Can lawlessness is holding us back, we
must clean it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg shook his head. &#8220;That&#8217;s easier said than
done. The town is on its own, and it gets its
revenue chiefly from our pay-rolls. The mines,
with the single exception of the Murtrie, don&#8217;t
amount to anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe the railroad people would help us out,&#8221;
suggested Altman, the smooth-faced, young-looking
mining engineer who was directing the granite
boring in the east-end tunnel heading. &#8220;Somebody
told me once that nearly all of the town is
built on land leased from the railroad company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look into this Powder Can business, myself,&#8221;
said David, as the conference broke up.
&#8220;The thing that&#8217;s biting us just now is the need
to show Mr. Grillage a clean slate when he comes.
He knows good work when he sees it, and I don&#8217;t
want to have to begin making excuses the minute
he lights down in Powder Gap. Go to it and key
things up to concert pitch.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the great machine grinding merrily under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
this new impetus, David Vallory did look cursorily
into the Powder Can situation, stealing time from
the strenuous activities to make inquiries as to
what might be done. Up to this time, when the
doing of something began to urge itself baldly as
an industrial necessity, he had been postponing
action in this particular field, excusing himself
upon what seemed to be the perfectly justifiable
plea that the mining-camp man-traps and their
curbing or abolition were matters outside of the
line of his duties; a view which he knew to be in
strict accordance with that of the president of his
company. It was not that he meant to adopt the
policy of the blind eye in principle. His promise
to Virginia Grillage forbade that. But the excuses
had opened the door to postponement.</p>

<p>Such were the surface indications of the vein
of reluctance; but deeper down there was another
reason for the postponement. Not at any time
since his arrival had David forgotten that Judith
Fallon was most probably still living in Powder
Can. If he should chance to meet her&mdash;which
was not at all unlikely&mdash;the entire question of his
responsibilities&mdash;a question which the lapse of
time, and the growing hope that he might one day
win the love of Virginia Grillage, had pushed into
the background&mdash;would be reopened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>As a result of his inquiries he soon found that
there would be little use in making an appeal to
the law. As Plegg had pointed out, the Powder
Gap region was far enough distant from civilization
to be a law unto itself. But there was the
hope that he might be able to make such representations
to the railroad people, who were the
lessors of the land upon which the town was built,
as might induce them to intervene on the side of
law and order. Being thus brought face to face
with the thorny duty, he enlisted Plegg; and after
the mess-tent supper they crossed the basin together
to make such a survey of the conditions as
would enable them to present the demoralizing
facts in their reality to the railroad company.</p>

<p>With one of the fortnightly pay-days less than
thirty-six hours in the past there was ample evidence
of the malignance of the social and industrial
ulcer. The wide-open resorts were packed
with throngs of the Grillage workmen, and the
harvesting of the hard-earned dollars was in full
swing.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see it all while we&#8217;re about it,&#8221; said
David; and with Plegg at his elbow he pushed his
way through one of the crowded bar-rooms to a
den at the rear where a faro-game was running,
with the circle of sitters backed by eager gamblers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
who reached over the shoulders of the chair circle
to place their bets. Outside in the bar there was
noise enough, but here the strained silence was
broken only by the clicking of the counters, the
heavy breathing of the men, and the silken whisper
of the cards as the dealer ran them from his box.
David let his gaze sweep the table circle and come
to rest upon the forbidding features of the man
who was running the cards; a swarthy, heavy-faced
giant with Indian-like hair, drooping mustaches
that only half veiled a mouth of utter ruthlessness,
and eyes that were at the moment as dead
as the pallor showing beneath the Mexican-darkness
of his skin.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Black Jack&#8217; Dargin,&#8221; Plegg whispered in
Vallory&#8217;s ear. &#8220;He owns and runs this place, and
does his own dealing, but he has another sort of
dive a little farther up the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory&#8217;s jaw was set when they had
worked their way out to the open air.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t even a square game!&#8221; he gritted.
&#8220;What I don&#8217;t know about faro would fill a book,
but any sober man with eyes in his head could see
that that scoundrel was running a stacked deck!
Who is this Dargin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen,&#8221; said Plegg shortly. &#8220;In a way,
he&#8217;s the boss of this camp; has a reputation as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
&#8216;killer&#8217; and he has traded on it until he has everybody
&#8216;buffaloed.&#8217; He is the only faro dealer I&#8217;ve
ever seen who would consent to run a game without
a &#8216;lookout.&#8217; He makes a brag of it; says all
he needs is a boy to sell the chips. The woman is
the only human being in this camp who has ever
made him take a stand-off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The woman?&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I keep forgetting that you&#8217;re new. She
is another example of Dargin&#8217;s cave-man methods.
When the work began here in the Gap last September,
Dargin was about the first man on the
ground for the shekel harvest. He opened this
place and a dance-hall, killed a man or two to get
himself properly dreaded, and began to rake in
the easy money. About that time the woman
dropped in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God pity her, whoever she is,&#8221; was David&#8217;s
comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a curious case,&#8221; Plegg went on, as they
walked together up a street blatant with the roistering
crowds. &#8220;Shortly after the dissipations
had caught their stride a young plunger from
somewhere back east turned up here and took
rooms in the Hophra House. As nearly as I could
learn at the time, the young ass was rich&mdash;or at
least a rich man&#8217;s son&mdash;and he had been stung on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
a Powder Can mining scheme. He came here to
see what he&#8217;d been let in for, and he didn&#8217;t have
any better sense than to bring his wife along&mdash;to
such a wolf-den as this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said David, with some dim premonition
warning him that, instead, he should have told
Plegg to stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know all the ins and outs of it; or just
how much or how little the woman was to blame.
But the upshot of the matter was that one day,
right in the face and eyes of the whole camp, as
you might say, Black Jack backed this young fool
up against a wall, stuck a gun into his face, and
gave him a quick choice between passing out there
and then, or buying his life and a chance to vanish
by giving up all claims to his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; the listener ejaculated.
&#8220;Cave-man is right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the laws of the jungle that Kipling
didn&#8217;t mention,&#8221; was the first assistant&#8217;s terse summing-up.
&#8220;Dargin saw something that he wanted,
and that was his way of reaching out and taking it.
But now comes the queer part of it. The young
plunger disappeared between two days, and everybody
looked to see the woman take up with Dargin.
But that isn&#8217;t what happened. She stayed
on at the Hophra House for a few days and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
sent for her father, a poor devil of a machinist
who seemed to be trying to drink himself to death.
Either she or Dargin got him a job at the Murtrie
mine, and the two of them set up housekeeping in
one of the mine shacks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dargin and the woman, you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! the woman and her father. And that&#8217;s
the way it has been ever since. Making all due
allowances for the time and place, Dargin&#8217;s relations
with the woman are the only half-way decent
ones he has. The old man was drunk half the
time, so Dargin gave the girl a job playing the
piano in his dance-hall&mdash;by way of giving her a
chance to earn an honest living, you&#8217;d say. That
seems to be as far as it has gone, except that one
day last fall a tipsy &#8216;hard-rock&#8217; man tried to take
liberties with the girl at the piano, and when she
fought him, struck her. He skipped out, across
the range, but Black Jack caught up with him and
shot him.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory&#8217;s premonition of coming tragedy
had been fulfilled long before Plegg reached this
point in his story, but if there had been any doubt
as to the woman&#8217;s identity the incident of the
&#8220;hard-rock&#8221; man would have dispelled it. Oddly
enough, the filling-out of Judith Fallon&#8217;s story did
not seem to lessen his own feeling of moral obligation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
on the contrary, it increased it. More
than ever, as it appeared, it was needful that
Judith should be taken quickly out of the false
position into which her relations, innocent or
otherwise, with the man-killer had placed her.</p>

<p>By this time their progress up the single street
of the town had brought them to another of the
resorts; a dance-hall, this, also with its bar-room
annex. There was little room on the dancing-floor
for spectators, and they did not try to enter. But
enough could be seen from the bar to determine
the character of the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Dargin&#8217;s other place,&#8221; said Plegg.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the least tough of any of the Powder Can
joints, and the money is made over the bar. If a
man gets too well &#8216;lit up&#8217; he is thrown out. Most
of the women you see in there are the miners&#8217;
wives and daughters. It hurts us chiefly because
it attracts men who would neither gamble nor
drink if they didn&#8217;t start in here on a sort of social
plane.&#8221;</p>

<p>David nodded and was turning away when a
hand was laid on his arm and he wheeled quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judith!&#8221; he gasped. Then, as Plegg stood
aside and pretended not to see or hear; &#8220;My
God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;&#8217;tis &#8216;Judith&#8217; now, and never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
&#8216;Glory&#8217; any more. What brings you here,
Davie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;partly,&#8221; he blurted out. &#8220;Put something
on and come outside. I want to talk to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she refused bluntly; and then, to temper
the bluntness: &#8220;&#8217;Tis no good it can do now, Davie,
and &#8217;twould do you harm. There be tongues to
wag, even in Powder Can, and you&#8217;re the chief on
the big job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must see you and talk with you!&#8221; he insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill do no good,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;I&#8217;ve made
my bed, Davie, and I&#8217;ve got to lie on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bar-room throng was jostling them as they
stood, and David saw the bartender marking them
through half-closed eyes. He fancied there was
crafty suspicion in the look, but at the moment he
was thinking chiefly of the obligation that he must
not shirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall come again, in daytime,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You are living on the Murtrie claim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not!&#8221; she forbade quickly.
&#8220;&#8217;Twould be&mdash;it might be as much as your life&#8217;s
worth! Nor must you stay here talking to me.
Go now, or the Plegg man will be asking questions
that you can&#8217;t answer!&#8221; And with that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
slipped aside and lost herself in the throng on the
dancing-floor.</p>

<p>David Vallory was gravely silent on the remainder
of the round of investigation; and Plegg,
knowing that something sobering had happened at
Dargin&#8217;s dance-hall, respected his chief&#8217;s mood.
But on the way back to the construction camp the
silence was broken by David himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw the woman I was talking to in that
place across from the Murtrie ore yard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know who she is?&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg nodded. &#8220;She is the one I was talking
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it. And the hound who brought her
here? I believe you didn&#8217;t mention his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Hudson&mdash;no, that isn&#8217;t quite it&mdash;Judson;
Thomas Judson.&#8221;</p>

<p>To the astonishment of the reticent, self-contained
first assistant, David Vallory lifted his
clenched hands to the stars and swore savagely.
But as Plegg had respected his chief&#8217;s former
silence, so now he respected the wrathful outburst.
Farther along, when they were crossing the tracks
in the material yard, David offered niggard explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew the woman, back home, Plegg; I grew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
up with her. If ever a man needed killing, Tom
Judson is that man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were not married?&#8221; said Plegg.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no reason to believe that they were.
But that doesn&#8217;t excuse Judson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not; it makes it worse&mdash;if he was
the original sinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was,&#8221; said David; &#8220;but he was not the only
one.&#8221; And with that he shut his mouth like a
trap and did not open it again until they reached
the steps of their bunk car. Then he said shortly:
&#8220;I am going up to Brady&#8217;s Cut. You needn&#8217;t
leave the lamp burning for me when you turn in;
I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ll get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>In naming the place to which he was going,
David gave the first assistant only the outward
husk of the kernel of truth. As he tramped his
stumbling course over the unevenly spaced cross-ties
of the construction track in the general direction
of Brady&#8217;s, he was thinking little enough of
the work at the cutting or of anything connected
with the affairs of the Grillage Engineering Company.
Taking their revenge for a long period of
banishment into a limbo of things conveniently
pushed aside, the thoughts that had once harassed
him into something like a congestive chill of moral
remorse assailed him afresh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>The woman he had unconsciously led up to the
brink of the chasm had not only gone over; she
had sunk to a depth perilously near the bottom.
There could be no doubt of what the end would
be. For some inscrutable reason of his own,
Dargin, &#8220;the killer,&#8221; was according her such a
measure of respect as his cave-man attributes were
capable of entertaining for anything in the shape
of a woman. But that was the most that could be
said. Poor Gloriana! What a bitter price she
was paying! And with what portion of that price
must he, David Vallory, in justice charge himself?</p>

<p>Reaching the approach to Brady&#8217;s Cut, a huge
gash torn through the side of one of the rounded
basin hills, David turned to his left and climbed
steadily until he attained the sparse growth of
trees crowning the hill at the edge of the great
cutting. Below him the ordered pandemonium of
industry was in full stride. Under the light of
masthead arcs, two mammoth steam-shovels rattled
and clanked, the sharp staccato of their exhaust
pipes echoing from the surrounding heights
like the cachinnations of some invisible and mocking
giant of the immensities. Between the shovels
rooting like prehistoric monsters into the banks
on either hand, a grunting locomotive pushed its
train of dump-cars for the spoil, moving them so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
accurately that the circling shovel buckets to right
and left never failed of an empty hopper into
which to drop the three-ton torrent of mingled
clay and broken stone.</p>

<p>David Vallory cast himself down at the edge of
the cutting with his back to one of the little trees.
The chattering clamor of the industries floated up
to him on a thin nimbus of coal smoke; but when
the senses are turned inward the near and the
actual lose their appeal. Once more the fair
structure of David&#8217;s imaginings was preparing to
topple&mdash;a structure that he had thought Judith&#8217;s
disappearance from Middleboro, leaving no trace,
gave him leave to rear. But now their paths had
crossed again; she was here, almost within rifle-shot
of the tree against which he was leaning. And
in a day or two Virginia Grillage would come.
Was it mere chance, or an avenging fate, that was
about to place him at the converging point of a
great happiness and an equally great reckoning
with a past that could never be recalled?</p>

<p>It was far past midnight when he got up and
shook himself as one awaking from a troubled
dream. Down on the construction track he saw
a train of flat-cars bringing the two-o&#8217;clock shifts
to relieve the gangs which had gone on in the early
evening. Above the mechanical clamor in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
cutting at his feet he could hear the upcoming men
singing raucously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bellow it out&mdash;it&#8217;s little enough you have to
trouble you!&#8221; he grated, apostrophizing the singing
workmen. Then he turned his steps toward
the distant material yard, avoiding the approaching
train, and closing sullen ears to the noisy
human atoms who had no troubles.</p>

Bridge Number Two</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SINCE he was now able to argue from a personal
knowledge of the Powder Can facts,
David Vallory was ready to go to the railroad
officials with a plea for intervention and relief.
But with his own president&#8217;s visit impending he
was unwilling to absent himself for the needful
trip to the railroad headquarters in Brewster. In
this small dilemma a bit of gossip trickling in over
the construction line wire from Agorda, the point
at which the new grade diverged from the old,
offered an alternative. There was a right-of-way
claim to be adjusted at Agorda, and the gossiping
wire said that the Short Line&#8217;s legal representative
had come up from Brewster on the morning
train to settle with the claimants.</p>

<p>Seizing the opportunity, David Vallory boarded
an empty material train backing out of the Powder
Gap yards and in due time was set down at the
desolate little junction station at the foot of
Mount Latigo. There was a private car standing
on one of the side-tracks, and inquiry at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
telegraph office developed the fact that the right-of-way
claimants had already had their day in
court, and Mr. Jolly was in his car, waiting for
the afternoon train to come along and tow him
back to Brewster.</p>

<p>Walking down the tracks to the occupied siding,
David presented himself at the door of the
private car and was welcomed effusively by a
round-bodied little gentleman with a face like a
full moon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vallory, hah!&mdash;do I get the name right?&mdash;always
want to get a man&#8217;s name right&mdash;demned
awkward to find that you&#8217;ve been calling Smith
Jones, when his name is Smith,&#8221; bubbled the welcomer.
&#8220;Sit down&mdash;sit down, Mr. Vallory, and
be at home. Of the Grillage Engineering Company,
you say? Big job you&#8217;ve got on your
hands here&mdash;tre-mendous job! How&#8217;s it coming
along?&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory braced himself as one stepping
out of shelter into a blustering March wind.
Gusty talkers had always been his pet aversion,
and he seemed to have encountered the original
of the type. By taking persevering advantage of
the lulls between the gusts he contrived to explain
his errand. The Powder Can situation was
thus and so. The Grillage company had no jurisdiction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
and he understood that the Short Line
company, in its capacity as owner of the town site,
might possibly be able to intervene on the side of
law and order. How about it?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, hah! my dear Mr. Vallory! what do
you take us for?&#8221; cackled the gusty one. &#8220;We&#8217;re
not an eleemosynary institution, any more than
you are! Why, hah! bless your heart, if we
should go into the moral-issue business in these
mountains we&#8217;d last as a railroad corporation just
about as long as it would take an indignant State
legislature to repeal our charter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have stated the case clumsily, Mr.
Jolly; I&#8217;m not asking you to do more than any
respectable landlord ought to be willing to do,&#8221;
David persisted firmly. &#8220;Your property in Powder
Can is being put to uses which were never
contemplated when the leases were signed. A
public nuisance harmful to your neighbors has
developed, and you ought to be willing to help
abate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing to be done, I assure you, my dear
young man. Those Powder Can leases are mere
matters of form, to enable us to hold what land
we may need for railroad purposes after the new
line is opened. I&#8217;m not sure, but I think the consideration
was the usual one dollar, or something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
of that sort. We can&#8217;t police Powder Can for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; we&#8217;ll drop the moral argument and
take up another,&#8221; said David, stubbornly. &#8220;The
railroad company has set a time limit on the completion
of this new line. The Powder Can nuisance
is delaying the work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, hah! is up to your people, Mr. Vallory.
The contract provides for forfeitures if you don&#8217;t
come within the time limit, and a bonus if you
better it. You can&#8217;t stand it on that leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was just here that David lost his temper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not making any charges, Mr. Jolly, but
an unprejudiced outsider might take the view that
the railroad company, or some of its officials, are
profiting by the continued existence of a wide-open
town where our men are robbed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly the moon-like face of the railroad attorney
became a blank.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I shouldn&#8217;t make any such charge as that,
if I were you,&#8221; he barked. And then, abruptly:
&#8220;Have you taken this matter up with your own
president? Or are you going it alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no reason why I should take it up
with Mr. Grillage. He holds me responsible for
the work, and for the conditions under which we
are working.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well,&#8221; snapped the lawyer.
&#8220;But if you are ever tempted to make that charge
you speak of, Mr. Vallory, you&#8217;d better think
twice. The natural counter-charge would be that
your own officials have a much better chance for
a Powder Can rake-off than ours have. Like
yourself, I&#8217;m making no accusations; but I&#8217;ll say
this: when you see Mr. Eben Grillage next, you
ask him plainly what he wants you to do about
this Powder Can business. If he tells you to
clean it up, maybe our people can be induced to
help.&#8221; Then, as if some secret spring had been
touched, the full-moon face lightened up and the
gusty joviality slipped into place again: &#8220;But, hah!
that&#8217;s enough of these disagreeable topics. You&#8217;re
my guest, Mr. Vallory: you&#8217;ll stop and take a
noon bite with me, won&#8217;t you? I&#8217;ve, hah! got a
fairly good cook on the car.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wishing nothing less than to be entertained
by a verbal March wind, David Vallory pleaded
a press of work, escaped, and was fortunate
enough to catch the loaded material train as
it was starting up the new line. He was soberly
depressed, not so much by the lawyer&#8217;s attitude,
which he had partially discounted before the interview,
as by the seed which had been planted
by Jolly&#8217;s retort to his own small outburst of temper.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
The thought that his employer and the Vallory
benefactor could be profiting, however indirectly,
by sharing with the Powder Can pirates
was grossly incredible&mdash;a thought to be cast down
and indignantly trodden upon. Yet it is the
fashion of planted seeds to germinate quite irrespective
of the wishes of the soil into which they
have been thrust. David Vallory could not help
recalling the brief reference made to Powder Can
as the contractor-king was threshing out the details
with him on the eve of his outsetting: &#8220;A
tough mining-camp, running wide-open; but that&#8217;s
no affair of yours,&#8221; was the curt phrase in which
Eben Grillage had dismissed it.</p>

<p>It was on Crawford&#8217;s section of the new work
that David roused himself out of the depressive
reverie. The material train was rounding a long
curve on the approach to Bridge Number Two,
and the engineer checked its speed to slow for
the crossing of the little river on the temporary
trestle just beyond the bridge-building activities.
Dropping from the moving train a few hundred
yards from the bridge location, David was immediately
pounced upon by the square-shouldered
young athlete who was driving the work on Bridge
Number Two.</p>

<p>&#8220;By George! Mr. Vallory&mdash;you&#8217;re like an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
angel sent from heaven!&#8221; was the athlete&#8217;s enthusiastic
welcome. &#8220;Bittner has just &#8217;phoned
from down the line that Strayer, of the railroad
inspecting force, is on his way up here in a gas-car.
Will you flag him when he comes along and
hold him for a few minutes until I can get back
to the bridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>David, thinking pointedly of his late encounter
with the railroad attorney, nodded abstractedly.
&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll stop Strayer, if you want me to. But
what&#8217;s the object&mdash;what are you trying to cover
up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N-nothing,&#8221; Crawford explained hurriedly.
&#8220;I just want to make sure that those concrete fellows
are carrying out instructions. Strayer&#8217;s got
an eye like a hawk, and if so much as a single
piece of reinforcing steel happens to be an inch
out of line, he&#8217;ll see it and report that we&#8217;re not
living up to the specifications.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said David; &#8220;go to it,&#8221; and he sat
down on a projecting cross-tie end to wait for the
railroad inspector&#8217;s gas-velocipede to come in
sight.</p>

<p>From the cross-tie waiting-place on the inner
side of the long curve the bridge under construction
was in plain view. It was a single short arch
spanning the stream; the false-work and wooden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
forming were in place, and from the a&euml;rial spout
of the distributing tower a continuous trickle of
concrete was pouring into the box-like forms.
David Vallory&#8217;s half-absent gaze followed Crawford&#8217;s
retreating figure. When it reached the
bridge the distance-softened grind of the concrete
mixer and hoist stopped abruptly, and the absent-minded
onlooker a few hundred yards down the
line saw Crawford climb to the bridge-head and
wave his arms.</p>

<p>The precise object of what followed was not
clearly apparent to a man thinking soberly of
something else. Other figures, silhouetted against
the sky-line, appeared, crawling out upon the
forms. When they erected themselves they
seemed to be tamping the concrete into place.
The young chiefs conclusion was the most obvious
one that offered. &#8220;Humph!&#8221; he muttered,
&#8220;he&#8217;s been letting his &#8216;mix&#8217; go too dry, and he&#8217;s
ramming it so the water will come up. Strayer
would jump him for that, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a measure of the distance that one
Matthew Grimsby had led David along the road
to &#8220;salt&#8221; loyalty that he made no mental note to
&#8220;jump&#8221; Crawford himself for the forbidden practice
of ramming dry concrete into bridge forms;
and when the motor-driven inspection car appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
at the farther end of the curve he got up
to flag it. As it chanced, the big, bearded engineer
who was driving the car was no less ready
to stop than David was to have him stop. With
the brakes locked he sprang out and fired his
battery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was hoping I&#8217;d find you somewhere this side
of the Gap,&#8221; he rasped. &#8220;There&#8217;s no use talking,
Vallory, you fellows have got to hew closer to
the line or you&#8217;ll hear something drop. If you
think, because Lushing happens to be away, you
can put something across on us every day or two,
you&#8217;ve got another guess coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve met you before, Strayer,&#8221; said David,
with his slow smile. &#8220;I worked with a round
half-dozen of you all last summer and fall in Wisconsin.
What&#8217;s gone wrong now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That fill at Havercamp&#8217;s. The specifications
call for solid work on the fills. Your man is burying
unbroken chunks of clay in that embankment
as big as he can pick up with his steam-hog. The
first heavy snow that melts back of that fill will
make it look like a toboggan slide!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll look into the Havercamp fill,&#8221; said David
mildly. &#8220;Anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; the cutting just below Havercamp&#8217;s,
where they&#8217;re getting the spoil for the fill. I asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
the foreman just now if he considered that the
lower side of the cutting was worked back to the
required angle. He said that he did, and it was;
but when I put my instrument on it, I found that
there is still a good six-foot slice to come off. It
won&#8217;t do, Vallory; you&#8217;ve got to quit this business
of cost-shaving at every twist and turn that offers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not in the contracting business for our
health,&#8221; was David Vallory&#8217;s good-natured retort;
&#8220;I admit it. When you find anything wrong,
we correct it, don&#8217;t we? And you&#8217;re here to find
the wrong things, aren&#8217;t you? If we should toe
the mark all the time, you&#8217;d be out of a job. I&#8217;ll
look after the cutting. What next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next I&#8217;ll have a squint at this bridge of Crawford&#8217;s.
When you fellows take to pouring concrete,
you need to have a man standing over you
day and night. If you&#8217;re headed my way, get on
the car and I&#8217;ll give you a ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory accepted the invitation, climbing
into the second seat of the three-wheeled car.
At the approach to the temporary wooden trestle
over which the construction track ran, the car was
halted and they crossed to the new structure.</p>

<p>The machinery was grinding again by this time
and David Vallory stood aside while the railroad
engineer went carefully over the job. The big,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
bearded inspector took nothing for granted. The
&#8220;mix&#8221; was examined, samples of the cement were
taken, a handful of the sand was put into a bottle
with water, shaken, and allowed to settle to determine
its purity. On the work itself nothing
escaped him; he even counted the steel reinforcing
bars whose ends stuck up out of the rising tide of
soft concrete, checking the number against the
figures in his field-notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something radically wrong here,&#8221; he grinned,
when the final item had been checked. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
first time I haven&#8217;t found Jimmy Crawford trying
to put something over on me. What&#8217;s the
matter, Jimmy&mdash;got religion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said Crawford, with a sly wink for his
chief. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you know Mr. Vallory holds revival
meetings in his bunk car every little while?
You ought to come up some night and we&#8217;ll convert
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going up, right now,&#8221; Strayer announced;
and it was thus that David got a motor-car ride
all the way to the Gap, the railroad watch-dog
enlivening the journey with additional criticisms
as they went along.</p>

<p>It was after they had reached the headquarters
camp, and David had invited the railroad man
into his office bunk car for an intermission smoke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
that the bluff inspector dipped abruptly into the
personalities.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like you, Vallory,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve been
wondering for a solid month how you ever came
to tie up with this Grillage outfit. Would you
mind telling me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least. Mr. Grillage and my father
are old friends; they were schoolmates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That stops me dead,&#8221; was Strayer&#8217;s rejoinder.
&#8220;I shan&#8217;t say any of the things I was going to
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It needn&#8217;t stop you,&#8221; was David&#8217;s surrejoinder.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it does. Under such conditions you have
personal relations with Father Eben; you can&#8217;t
help having them. And that reminds me, he is
in Brewster now, on his way up here. Did you
know he was coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I heard of it through the hotel people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got his daughter with him. Did you
know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not positively, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leaving her father entirely out of it, she&#8217;s a
mighty fine young woman,&#8221; said Strayer. &#8220;I met
her when she was here last September. She didn&#8217;t
seem to think that a railroad inspecting engineer
was merely a new kind of dog to be kicked off
the door-step.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>&#8220;Neither do I,&#8221; David asserted. &#8220;You think
we are a bunch of crooks on our side, and we
know you want to get something for nothing on
yours. There needn&#8217;t be anything personal about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man&#8217;s grin bared a marvelously fine
set of teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> crooks, Vallory; so crooked that it
would break a snake&#8217;s back to try to keep up
with you. If Eben Grillage wasn&#8217;t your father&#8217;s
friend, I&#8217;d say that he ought to have a middle
name beginning with the letter &#8216;S&#8217; for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is my father&#8217;s friend&mdash;and mine,&#8221; interrupted
David, with a little of the emphasis
belligerent on the verb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! I&#8217;ll quit. And to make up for the
implied slam, I&#8217;ll give you a little pointer, Vallory.
This business of systematically dodging
specifications has about run its course, and it&#8217;s
going to get you in bad. Our people have been
taking it rather easy and contenting themselves
with checking you up in spots and making you
make good. Do you get me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m listening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. That was the way it ran along at
first. But now it&#8217;s beginning to be whispered
around in our headquarters that the Grillage company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
is out for blood on this contract; that no
amount of inspection can keep you from skinning
us alive&mdash;which the same you are doing. That
isn&#8217;t a healthy state of affairs, and it ought to be
cured before the whisper spreads, let us say, to
the Executive Board in New York. Are you on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; David challenged stubbornly. Then he
fell back upon the seller&#8217;s time-worn argument:
&#8220;You are getting all you pay for, and more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough said,&#8221; laughed Strayer, getting up to
go. &#8220;No offense meant, and none taken, I hope.
But you say Mr. Grillage is your friend, and&mdash;well,
it&#8217;s just a word to the wise, that&#8217;s all. So
long, till I see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somewhat later in the day, returning from a
trip to Brady&#8217;s Cut, David paused on the sheltered
side of the office bunk car to light his pipe.
A window was open, and he heard voices within;
the voices, namely, of young Jimmy Crawford
and Silas Plegg. Crawford had come to camp
for a missing detail drawing of some part of
Bridge Number Two, and Plegg was getting it
for him out of the blueprint locker.</p>

<p>&#8220;A close squeak,&#8221; Crawford was saying. &#8220;If
Bittner hadn&#8217;t been thoughtful enough to &#8217;phone,
I&#8217;d have been caught red-handed. I lost my head
for a minute and ran down the track to flag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
Strayer, meaning to choke the big stiff if I couldn&#8217;t
think of any other way of keeping him off. Just
then the material train came along and the boss
dropped off right at my feet. He was a Godsend,
and I used him, got him to stay and flag
Strayer while I ran back and got busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Plegg&#8217;s voice: &#8220;Did you tell Mr. Vallory
what you were going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not hardly!&#8221; was Crawford&#8217;s laughing denial;
&#8220;not after the song and dance you gave us
fellows a while back, just after the boss came on
the job. I just told him that Strayer was coming,
and that I&#8217;d like to have him hindered until
I could make sure everything was ship-shape for
an inspection. He seemed to be thinking pretty
hard about something else, but he was good-natured
enough to sit down on a tie-end and wait
for Strayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>David&#8217;s pipe was alight and he moved away.
What he had overheard merely confirmed his former
assumption that Crawford had been tamping
dry concrete to make it appear wet, and he thought
no more of it. But if his match had gone out
and he had been obliged to light another on the
windless side of the bunk car....</p>

<p>Plegg seemed to be having trouble in the search
for the missing drawing, and Crawford rattled on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;When I got back to the bridge I turned the
whole gang loose on the stage-setting. It was
some swift job, believe me, and I didn&#8217;t know
what minute Strayer&#8217;s car&#8217;d come chugging around
the curve. I&#8217;ve got so I keep a bunch of short
steels handy, and we stuck &#8217;em up in the concrete
to look as if they grew there. Strayer counted
&#8217;em when he came, as he always does, and they
checked out right, of course. But say, Plegg, if
he&#8217;d touched one of the dummies it would have
tumbled over! The concrete had been running a
bit thin, and it was all we could do to make the
short pieces stand up long enough to be counted.
As it was, two or three of &#8217;em fell down just as
Strayer and the boss were climbing to their places
in the inspection car. That&#8217;s why I say it was a
close squeak.&#8221;</p>

<p>This, then, was what David missed by not
having to light a second match. Instead of a
practically harmless ramming of dry concrete,
Crawford had been covering up another item of
the cost-cutting. One of the commonest economies
in concrete construction is the scanting of
the steel which binds the mass together and adds
its strength to that of the cement. The contract
specifications called for a stated number of these
bars in Bridge Number Two. Following the Grillage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
practice, certain of these bars had been left
out&mdash;to save their cost. Crawford had made his
dummy bars figure as permanences for Strayer,
and the trick was turned.</p>

<p>But of all this David Vallory knew nothing;
and since his pipe was now drawing freely, he
mounted to the cab of one of the construction
locomotives to have himself conveyed to the tunnel
mouth on the eastern slope of the great mountain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII<br />


Under the High Stars</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was in the evening of the day in which David
Vallory had been twice told that his president
was on the way to Powder Gap that the stub train
forming the connecting link between the main line
and the construction headquarters came in with a
private Pullman for a trailer. David was four
miles away, in the eastern heading of the big tunnel,
at the moment, but the service telephone line
quickly transmitted the news of the big boss&#8217;s arrival.
An hour farther along, after a hurried
supper in the mess-tent at Brady&#8217;s cut, David took
a short path across the basin and climbed the
forested ridge to the Alta Vista Inn.</p>

<p>He had his reward for the haste, the primitive
meal, and the rapid climb when he came in sight
of the Inn and its rustic porches. The radiant
daughter of profit-gaining contracts was there in
visible presence; David singled her out instantly
among the people lounging on the westward-facing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
porch. She stood at the railing, leaning against
one of the rough tree-trunk porch pillars and gazing
out upon the sunset which was painting itself
in colorings known only to the high altitudes.
David drew near, treading softly. It was a
lover&#8217;s fancy that the glories of the sunset were
reflected in the starry eyes, in the ripe lips parted
a little as if in the rapture of the vision, and in
the warm tintings of neck and cheek.</p>

<p>When he finally stood beside her she gave him
her hand without loosing her eye-hold upon the
crimson-shot glories.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it perfectly exquisite!&#8221; she breathed, accepting
the fact of his presence quite as if their
parting in the lakeside mansion had been but the
day before.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sunset? Naturally; they are built that
way out here. But you mustn&#8217;t expect me to rhapsodize
over the scenery when I can look at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t be frivolous,&#8221; she chided.
&#8220;There are plenty of others to say the silly
things; and besides, it isn&#8217;t your&mdash;it isn&#8217;t in character.
Stand here and enjoy this with me while
it lasts, and then we&#8217;ll go somewhere and talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>David acquiesced willingly enough, and after
the sunset had faded, and they had found chairs
in the corner farthest removed from the chattering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
groups of summer people, he told her of his
few weeks of strenuous work, enlarging in boyish
enthusiasm upon the magnitude of the job and
the possibilities of man-sized growth it offered to
those who were driving it.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you haven&#8217;t had any trouble?&#8221; she interrogated,
after the story was told.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not what you would call trouble; no. Of
course, the railroad inspectors make life miserable
for us when they can, but that is all in the
day&#8217;s work. It amuses them and keeps them out
of mischief, and it doesn&#8217;t hurt us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should they make life miserable for
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask me that?&mdash;and you the only daughter
of the king of the contractors?&#8221; he laughed.
&#8220;That is what they are hired for; to find fault,
and to get us to give them something for nothing
if they can.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point it pleased Miss Virginia to play
the part of the innocent and the uninformed.</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know anything about it?&#8221; she
queried. &#8220;Could you explain it so that a woman
could understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can explain it so that this one woman I&#8217;m
talking to can understand. Have you ever happened
to read a contract and specifications?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;What a question!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t suppose you had. They are like the
Congressional Record&mdash;nobody reads them unless
it&#8217;s a necessity. But they are fearfully and wonderfully
constructed. One of the clauses in the
regulation form reads something like this: &#8216;The
engineer of the party of the first part&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s
the railroad company in the present instance&mdash;&#8216;reserves
the right to pass upon all work and material,
and to reject either if found, in his judgment,
to be unsatisfactory.&#8217; Mark the wording
and you&#8217;ll notice that it leaves an open door wide
enough to drive a locomotive through. And up
here we have a man against us who would like to
hitch a whole train of cars to the locomotive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lushing, you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you met him yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet; he hasn&#8217;t been on the job in person
since I came. I understand he has gone East.
But he has left some pretty able fault-finders to
represent him, I can assure you. If there is anything
in the category of crime that they don&#8217;t accuse
us of committing, it is something they have
temporarily forgotten. But you mustn&#8217;t make me
talk shop all the time. I&#8217;m sure it bores you, only
you are too good-natured to say so.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>&#8220;A man&#8217;s work, if it is at all worth while,
ought not to bore anybody. It is your life, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was, up to just a little while ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened a little while ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is another of the sayings that doesn&#8217;t
fit,&#8221; she warned him.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; we&#8217;ll talk about something else.
How long can you stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Father is calling it his vacation,
and threatens to go trout-fishing in the mountains.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be fine. If I didn&#8217;t have to watch
Lushing&#8217;s outfit so closely, I&#8217;d like to go with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up quickly. &#8220;Have you ever had
a real vacation, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not; not in your sense of the word.
I was out on field work during the four college
summers. I&#8217;m saving up for my honeymoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you said that was only a dream; a
&#8216;pipe-dream,&#8217; you called it, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did; and it is. I was only joking. The
only thing I can talk seriously about is the big
job. And you are not interested especially in that&mdash;or
are you? Plegg said one day when we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
speaking of you that you were a pretty good little
engineer. I&#8217;m quoting him literally. He meant
it as a compliment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Plegg,&#8221; she said, with a touch of abstraction
which the mention of the first assistant&#8217;s name
seemed to evoke. &#8220;Do you like him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Immensely; though he always gives me the
feeling that there are nooks and corners in him
that he never allows anybody to explore. I met
him first a year ago. It was in the Pullman, when
I was going home from Florida. He had the
upper berth in my section, and we scraped an acquaintance
of a sort just as the train was pulling
into Middleboro, though neither of us learned the
other&#8217;s name. I remembered him chiefly on account
of his sardonic smile, and a queer thing he
said to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will the queer thing bear repeating?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To you, yes. He made a running commentary
on my face&mdash;like one of those street-corner physiognomists,
you know; eyes, nose, jaw, and so on,
and said I&#8217;d probably go far in my profession if
I wasn&#8217;t too good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What an exceedingly odd thing for a stranger
to say to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it? But he was so genial about it that
I couldn&#8217;t take offense.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>&#8220;What did he mean by not being &#8216;too good&#8217;?&#8221;
she questioned gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know at the time, but I&#8217;ve found out
since. I grew up with a good many old-fashioned
notions, I guess, and I&#8217;m not sure that I haven&#8217;t
got some of them yet. One of them that I&#8217;ve
been trying to modify was the belief that a man
might set up his own standards and live by them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have that same belief now,&#8221; asserted the
daughter of the luxuries. &#8220;Why are you trying
to modify it? Isn&#8217;t it reasonable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is reasonable enough, and it is right and
proper that you should have it. It is your
woman&#8217;s privilege to believe the best of everything.
But the man has to take the world as he
finds it.&#8221; Thus far he was merely skirting judiciously
upon the safer edges of the generalizations.
But the next moment he found himself
yielding to the temptation which so easily besets
the average man&mdash;to confide in a woman. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
tell you, Virginia; I&#8217;ve done things in the past
year that I would never have dreamed of doing
in my callow days; things that would make my
father gasp if he knew about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wicked things?&#8221; she suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a time when I should have called
them wicked, without a shadow of doubt. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
that was before I had come to realize that business&mdash;all
kinds of business&mdash;is a sort of war; a
fight in which, if you don&#8217;t &#8216;get&#8217; the other fellow,
he&#8217;ll get you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are all wrong&mdash;hideously wrong!&#8221; she
broke out in a sudden passion of vehemence. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t mean in the statement of fact&mdash;that is only
too true. But in your own attitude. It is the
first of the downward steps: if you take that step
deliberately, there is no reason why you should
stop at anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was only soft starlight on the sheltered
porch, and David could smile in safety. The
little outburst of generous indignation carried him
swiftly back to the childhood days, reviving his
memory picture of a hot-hearted little girl whose
anger had always flamed fiercely at any spectacle
of wrong or oppression, and whose defending of
stray kittens and homeless dogs had more than
once made him fight in blind boyish rage&mdash;not for
the dogs and kittens, but for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t changed much, inside, since we
were babies together, and I&#8217;m glad of it,&#8221; he said,
after the momentary pause ushered in by the indignant
protest. &#8220;It is good of you not to make
me always think of you as the grown-up Miss
Virginia&mdash;the little sister of the luxuries.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>&#8220;There are times, David, when I hate the luxuries&mdash;knowing
so well the source of so many of
them,&#8221; she declared; and then: &#8220;Are you trying
to tell me that you have thrown all of the ideals
overboard?&#8221;</p>

<p>The appeal in her tone sobered him suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I hope not, Virginia. What I&#8217;ve been
saying applies only to business; the business conscience,
if you want to call it that. I have plenty
of the other kind left. And it&#8217;s giving me a lot
of trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the trouble like the professional things you
were talking about a few minutes ago?&mdash;explainable
to this woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; at least, not yet. It is a question of duty,
and how much duty. It is as if you had incurred
a debt and didn&#8217;t know the amount of it. You&#8217;d
be willing to pay, perhaps, if you only knew how
much to pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds entrancingly interesting,&#8221; she
said. And then: &#8220;To whom do you owe the debt,
David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I owe it to any one; or if
there really is a debt. I shall have to think it out,
and when I know, I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>From this their talk slipped back to the big job
and its askings and drawbacks, and so led up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
the moral cancer whose lights they could see
twinkling in the distance at the foot of Gold Hill.
David spoke of the demoralizing effects of the
cancer upon his working force, and told of his
futile effort to enlist the railroad people on the
side of reform.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ford would do something, if he knew,&#8221;
the young woman suggested, naming the president
of the P. S-W. system.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he would; but it is like climbing a
ladder a mile high to get to him. From what
Jolly said, I gathered that the Brewster officials
are absolutely indifferent, and to get at Mr. Ford
I&#8217;d have to go over their heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been in the mining-camp?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once, only, after dark. Some day you are
going to tell me the name of the man who took
your slumming party there last fall and I&#8217;ll go
and beat him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the man. Did you see Judith
Fallon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but only for a moment. I tried to get
a chance to talk to her, but she wouldn&#8217;t have
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is still living with her father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be afraid to tell me all of it,
David.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that he repeated Plegg&#8217;s short account of
the manner in which Judith Fallon had come to
Powder Can, and its near-tragic outcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;How terrible!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I remember Tom
Judson, just vaguely, as a handsome little kiddie
with light curly hair and the bluest of blue eyes.
And he&#8217;s grown up into <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and he didn&#8217;t take long about it, either,&#8221;
said David. &#8220;Long before he was expelled from
college he was Middleboro&#8217;s most shining example
of depravity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this other man; Dargin, did you call him?
Isn&#8217;t Judith worse off than if she had no protector
at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows,&#8221; said David, solemnly. &#8220;Except
for the single fact that he seems to have some respect
for her, he is the crudest of crude brutes,
according to Plegg&#8217;s story. It&#8217;s going to be
mighty hard to run him out of Powder Can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to try to run him out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s up to me, I guess. The railroad people
won&#8217;t do anything, and the place has got to be
cleaned up. This job of ours demands it. But
see here; can&#8217;t we keep this talk from stumbling
into the sink-holes? Tell me how long you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
going to be content to stay away from the luxuries?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you there were times when I hated the
luxuries. You must be awfully good to me if you
don&#8217;t want me to run away to the lavishnesses that
I use and despise in the same breath. I shall put
on a khaki skirt and leggings, and you&#8217;ll have to
show me everything that is going on. Have you
seen father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy me! I was to tell you to report to
him at the car down in the railroad yard if I saw
you first. I&#8217;m afraid I haven&#8217;t been a very obedient
call-boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>David got out of his chair reluctantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to realize that you are sending me
away&mdash;and that just as we were beginning to get
down to the real heart of things. May I come
back after your father is through with me? It is
so soul-satisfying not to have to divide time with
half a dozen other men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;other men,&#8217; as you call them, will probably
be here after a while; or some of them, at
least,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;And that reminds me; what
have you done about sending for your father and
sister? Nothing, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I have; I have done precisely what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
you said I ought not to do. They are coming,
and they will be here next week. I have taken
one of the hotel cottages for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was downright cruel, and you need to
be punished,&#8221; she retorted brightly. &#8220;And you
will be, too; you see if I&#8217;m not a true prophet.&#8221;
Then: &#8220;I think you needn&#8217;t come back this evening.
I shall probably be in bed and asleep long
before father lets you escape. Now don&#8217;t you
wish you hadn&#8217;t sent for your father and Lucille?&#8221;</p>

Altman&#8217;s Nerves</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF David Vallory were reluctant to leave the
hotel and make his way down the wooded
ridge to the gridironing of tracks in the railroad
yard, it was only because his duty was shortening
the evening with Virginia. Without being unduly
puffed up with a sense of his own efficiency,
he felt sure that his work would show for itself
and that there was no reason why he should hesitate
to spread the results before the president.</p>

<p>Not knowing where Mr. Grillage&#8217;s car had
been placed, it took him some few minutes to find
it in the crowded material yard, which was not
too well lighted by the widely spaced masthead
electrics. When he did find it, on the single unobstructed
spur-track, the nearest electric showed
him the figure of a man dropping from the car
step to become quickly lost in the shadows of the
surrounding material trains. In the brief glimpse
David recognized the alert poise and swinging
stride of his first assistant; but since neither jealousy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
nor suspicion had any part in the Vallory
make-up, the recognition evoked no wondering
query as to why Plegg had anticipated him in calling
upon Eben Grillage.</p>

<p>A moment later the porter had admitted him
and was standing aside to let him pass through
the vestibule to the open compartment in the rear
of the luxurious car. At the heavy, glass-topped
desk he found the contractor magnate sitting
alone, with the inevitable black and shapeless cigar
clamped between his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, David&mdash;come in!&#8221; was the brusque
greeting; and then with a grim chuckle: &#8220;By
George! I was beginning to think you were lost
out completely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was up at the tunnel when your train got
in,&#8221; David explained, judiciously slurring over
the interval which had elapsed since the early-evening
hour of the arrival.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when you crawled out of the tunnel you
found your way to the hotel and promptly forgot
all about the old duffer who has to dig down into
his jeans for the pay-roll money,&#8221; laughed the
man-driver in jovial humor. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right, my
boy; I was young once, myself. How goes the
job?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you will find it moving along all right,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
David ventured. Then he said a good word for
the first assistant. &#8220;Plegg had things in fine shape
when I took hold; good organization, good distribution,
and no friction. All that was needed
was a little pace-setting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve been setting the pace, eh? How
about the railroad inspectors?&mdash;are they giving
you much trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All we need, though as a general thing they
don&#8217;t say much to me personally; they go to Plegg.
One of them&mdash;Strayer&mdash;took me into his confidence
a bit to-day. He professes to believe that
we are deliberately burking the railroad company
and threw out a hint to the effect that the railroad
Executive Board might take some action.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get back at him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did; there hasn&#8217;t been a single instance where
we&#8217;ve failed to make good when they have called
us down, and I told him so. Strayer is acting chief
of the inspection staff in Lushing&#8217;s absence. I
haven&#8217;t seen Lushing yet. They tell me he has
gone East.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can add something to that,&#8221; said Lushing&#8217;s
former employer, with a sour smile. &#8220;He went
to New York to appear before the Executive
Board of his railroad&mdash;at his own request. We&#8217;ll
hear from him a little later.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>&#8220;I suppose he&#8217;s trying to make more trouble
for us,&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is. He is trying to force legal proceedings
to get our contract canceled. He threatened
to do that when we dropped him. He&#8217;s a vindictive
cuss, if ever there was one.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory shook his head in sympathetic
deprecation. He was too loyal himself to be able
to understand how a man, even if he were enraged,
could turn upon the hand that had fed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t do anything like that,&#8221; he asserted
confidently. &#8220;I&#8217;ve specialized a good bit in the
law of contracts&mdash;took it as a part of my college
course. As I see it, the railroad company has
absolutely no grounds whatever for cancellation.
As I&#8217;ve said, when Lushing&#8217;s inspectors bring up
a specific charge, we make good, and that&#8217;s the
end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since being in love with a man&#8217;s daughter is the
poorest possible preliminary to any accurate reading
of face signs when the subject chances to be
the father of the daughter, the slow drooping of
an eyelid on the part of the big man in the desk
chair opposite was quite thrown away upon David
Vallory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; agreed the contractor-king, with
a suppressed chuckle which he turned into a forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
clearing of his throat; &#8220;we&#8217;re up to all the little
methods of pacifying the enemy, eh, David?&#8221;
And then: &#8220;I&#8217;ve just had Plegg here, making him
tell tales out of school. Naturally, he didn&#8217;t want
to say much about his chief, but you&#8217;ve got his
vote, all right. He tells me you&#8217;ve made good
with the force, and that you&#8217;re a home-grown miracle
in the pace-setting. That is what I wanted to
hear; but it is also what I expected to hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More kindness,&#8221; said the beneficiary of the
kindness, with a comforting glow warming him.
&#8220;Before I went to Coulee du Sac I used to hear
that you were a hard man to work for. I shall
feel like scrapping with the next man who says
anything like that to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You go right on believing that I&#8217;m a hard
man,&#8221; said Eben Grillage, with a ferocious twinkle
of the shrewd eyes; &#8220;it&#8217;s safer. Now there&#8217;s
another little thing, while I think of it: Plegg was
telling me something about these dives and speak-easys
over in Powder Can; said you&#8217;d got stirred
up about &#8217;em and wanted to give &#8217;em the high
kick. You take a word of advice from me, David,
and let &#8217;em alone. After you&#8217;ve handled grade
laborers and hard-rock men as long as I have,
you&#8217;ll realize that they&#8217;re bound to have their
fling after pay-day. If you were an angel from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
heaven you couldn&#8217;t stop it. And you&#8217;ll only get
your hands muddy if you try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s such a tremendous drawback to the
work!&#8221; David protested, feeling, in his inmost
recesses, that this argument, rather than the
moral, would be more likely to appeal to Eben
Grillage.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the things you have to figure
on,&#8221; was the man-driver&#8217;s reply. &#8220;Pad your
gangs with a few extras to make up for the pay-day
absentees. Labor&#8217;s fairly plentiful just now,
and in the contracting business you&#8217;ll find that
man-muscle is about the cheapest material you
handle. But that&#8217;s enough about business. What
do you hear from your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mighty good news, just now. He hasn&#8217;t been
very well this spring, so I have persuaded him to
come out here for a while. I shall be looking for
him and my sister next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk!&#8221; exclaimed the Vallory benefactor.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll make him go trout-fishing with me.
And that drags us back to the business matter
again. I&#8217;m not out here to stand over you and
tell you what to do on the job, David; I&#8217;ve told
Vinnie it&#8217;s my vacation&mdash;something that I haven&#8217;t
had for so long that I&#8217;ve forgotten what it looks
like. I&#8217;ll make a little round of the work with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
you to-morrow, just to let the outfit see that you&#8217;ve
got the boss on your side, and after that you can
count me out. Vinnie probably won&#8217;t let you off
so easily, but you can settle that with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this program for a sort of stirrup-cup,
David Vallory left the president&#8217;s car with the
warm glow at his heart bursting into a generous
flame. In an age in which filial piety has come
to be more or less regarded as a hold-over from
an emotional elder generation, he found himself
inclining toward the savior of the good name of
the Vallorys with an affection akin to that which
he felt for the father who had begotten him.
That the industrial world held Eben Grillage as
a hard master, and the world of business looked
a trifle askance at his huge fortune and the manner
of its acquiring, were matters subsidiary to
the main question. Under the gruff exterior, the
grasping exterior, if his detractors would have
it so, David told himself there dwelt a giant of
generosity and loving-kindness; a man whose very
crudities and bluntnesses were lovable; a man
for whom his grateful beneficiaries could never
go too far, so long as the saving spark of gratitude
remained alive in the human breast.</p>

<p>It was with these exalted emotions stirring him
that he swung up to the step of his bunk car.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Since the car was lighted, he expected to find Silas
Plegg at work on his customary evening task of
checking the books of field-notes. But the only
occupant of the car proved to be young Altman,
who was driving the rock-blasting in the eastern
heading of the great tunnel; a sober-minded young
mining engineer only a year out of college, but yet
with the lines of responsibility already graving
themselves visibly in his boyish face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m disobeying orders, Mr. Vallory,&#8221; he began.
&#8220;Plegg tells us we mustn&#8217;t bother you with
our complaints, but in justice to my men I&#8217;ve got
to break over this one time. You know that weak
spot in the tunnel roof?&mdash;the one I showed you
the first time you were in?&#8221;</p>

<p>David nodded. The &#8220;weak spot&#8221; was a section
of the big bore which had been driven through
a prehistoric gash in the granite; a huge vertical
crack which had been filled with softer rock in
some later earth upheaval. &#8220;What about it?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting my goat. It is growing worse
every day, and I&#8217;m afraid it will come down on us.
Since we&#8217;re working three shifts, with a gang in
the heading all the time, you know what a cave-in
would mean; the shift that happened to be caught
behind it would die to the last man before it could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
be dug out. There&#8217;s enough of that slippery marl
hanging up in the &#8216;fault&#8217; to bury an army, and,
sooner or later, it&#8217;s going to come down. But I
can&#8217;t make Plegg see it that way at all. He says
I&#8217;ve got too many nerves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think the weak spot ought to be timbered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it ought; and the men think so, too.
There has been a good bit of grumbling and some
little strike talk among them, and I can&#8217;t blame
them. They say the company has no right to ask
them to take their lives in their hands for the sake
of saving a few dollars&#8217; worth of timbers. It was
my shift off this afternoon, but if I had known you
were going to be up there, I should have stayed
and asked you to take another look at the roof for
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go up to-morrow,&#8221; was David&#8217;s prompt
offer. &#8220;We mustn&#8217;t take chances on the lives of
your men. At the same time, it doesn&#8217;t pay to let
a thing of that kind get on your nerves, Fred.
The responsibility is up to Plegg and me, and we&#8217;ll
take care of it. Now you&#8217;d better hike back to
the bunk shack and catch up on your sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was less than a quarter of an hour after
Altman had gone when Silas Plegg came in and
found David Vallory preparing to go to bed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>&#8220;About that weak place in the tunnel roof in
heading Number One,&#8221; said David, pausing with
one lace-boot off. &#8220;Have you examined it lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on it ever since we
drove through it,&#8221; was the first assistant&#8217;s answer.
Then: &#8220;Has Altman been worrying you about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was here a few minutes ago. He seems
to think it&#8217;s dangerous, and says his men are protesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Altman is a fine young fellow, and an expert in
the rock-blasting, but he is a little inclined to be
nervous,&#8221; Plegg threw in. &#8220;That sort of thing
is always contagious, and Altman&#8217;s personal scare
has been spreading itself. That roof stood up
while we were driving through the fault, and I
guess it will continue to stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is any doubt about it, it ought to be
timbered,&#8221; was David&#8217;s decision. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking
to you, Plegg, for the carrying out of these routine
details.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to timber it,&#8221; said Plegg,
shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? The cost would be nothing compared
with what we&#8217;d lose in a strike of the hard-rock men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll guarantee the men won&#8217;t strike. And as
for the cost of the timbering; have you considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
what it would mean to us if we should call the attention
of the railroad inspectors to that bad spot
by propping it up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say that the railroad engineers,
and Lushing among them, don&#8217;t know about
that &#8216;fault&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re hoping they don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Plegg, with
the sardonic smile wrinkling slowly at the corners
of his eyes. &#8220;It would give Mr. James B. Lushing
the one big chance he is looking for. The day
in which we haul the first car-load of props into
the tunnel will be the day when he&#8217;ll fall on us like
a thousand of brick. We&#8217;ll get a peremptory
order from the railroad headquarters to shoot
that bad roof down and plug the hole with concrete.
That will mean a delay, maybe of weeks,
a forfeiture of our time-limit bond for the completion
of the job, and a bill of costs for the additional
work that will turn the Grillage company&#8217;s
profit into a loss heavy enough to make the
big boss sweat blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>David said nothing while he was slowly removing
the remaining lace-boot. When he spoke it
was to ask a curt question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Mr. Grillage know about this bad spot
in the tunnel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure he does. I sent him photographs when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
we were driving through it. He&#8217;s an old hand at
the rock-blasting, and he isn&#8217;t losing any sleep over
the cracked roof&mdash;which is cracked chiefly in Altman&#8217;s
imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>In some vague sense David Vallory felt that he
was confronting a crisis and another test of the
ideals. Before he realized it the battle was joined
between a just regard for human life on one hand,
and strict loyalty to Eben Grillage on the other.
Should he heed Altman&#8217;s warning and order the
timbering, regardless of the possible consequences
to the Grillage Engineering Company? Or
should he take Plegg&#8217;s assurances at their face
value and discount the fears of an overanxious
subordinate?</p>

<p>The daughter of the luxuries had possibly
spoken better than she knew in saying that the first
downward step in the ethical ladder makes all the
others easy. As David Vallory rolled himself
into the bunk blankets and turned his face away
from the light of the hanging lamp under which
Plegg was squaring himself for the nightly task of
field-note checking, the decision came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right about Altman&#8217;s nerves,
Plegg. Suppose you shift him to the quarry work
in Dixon&#8217;s Cut and put Regnier in the tunnel heading.
If I&#8217;m any judge of men, Regnier won&#8217;t let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
the spalling roof trouble him. He&#8217;ll be too busy
trying to break Altman&#8217;s record of so many feet
advance a day, and that will be some job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; said Plegg, bending lower over
the checking. But when David&#8217;s regular breathing
began, as it did almost at the instant of eye-closing,
the first assistant straightened up, shaking
his head regretfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a damned shame!&#8221; he muttered under his
breath. And then: &#8220;If I were half as loyal to him
as he is to Grillage, I&#8217;d blow the whole gaff&mdash;tell
him exactly what he is up against on this crooked
job, and at least give him a chance to fight with his
eyes open. Maybe I shall, some day&mdash;after it&#8217;s
everlastingly too late.&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV<br />


The Mucker</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR some little time after his chief had gone
to sleep, Silas Plegg bent thoughtfully over
his task at the trestle-table. It was said of him
that he could live and work with less sleep than
any other man on the staff, and his nightly vigils
proved it. Now and again the midnight workers
on some remote section of the job would look up
to find the first assistant staring down at them
from some coign of vantage, and the shirkers
never knew at what moment the cool, crisp voice
of the under-boss would come crackling out of the
shadows with a snap like that of a whip lash.</p>

<p>With the slipping of the rubber band over the
last of the field-books, Plegg rose noiselessly and
left the car as if to begin another of his nocturnal
rounds. In the shadow of the cement sheds he
overtook the yard watchman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything stirring, Mac?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; but that tunnel mucker they call
&#8216;Simmy&#8217;. Early in the evenin&#8217; I caught him prowlin&#8217;
&#8217;round the big boss&#8217;s private car. I asked him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
what he was doin&#8217; and he said he couldn&#8217;t sleep.
I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; thought nothin&#8217; of it if you hadn&#8217;t
told me to keep an eye out for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; much, &#8217;cept that the next time I come
around I catch him snoopin&#8217; under the windows of
yours and Mr. Vallory&#8217;s sleep-wagon. This time
I takes him by the ear and runs him over to his
bunk shack and tells him to stay there till his
shift&#8217;s called.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long ago was that?&#8221; Plegg inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout a half-hour, I reckon. He&mdash;Well,
I&#8217;ll be dog-goned! Look yonder!&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg had already seen. The sputtering light
of a distant masthead showed a lop-shouldered
figure making off across the yard, dodging as it
went to keep within the shadows cast by the scattered
material cars.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go after him,&#8221; said the watchman; but
Plegg stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mac; stay on your job. I think this may
be what I&#8217;ve been waiting for.&#8221; And as craftily
as if he had been trained in Indian warfare, the
first assistant set out to trail the dodging figure.</p>

<p>After the first few hundred yards down the
tracks it was not difficult to guess the tunnel
mucker&#8217;s destination. He was heading across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
basin to the mining-camp at the foot of Gold Hill.
Plegg did not try to keep him in sight after his
direction was assured, contenting himself with
closing the gap when the man ahead was entering
the single street of the town. Even then the pursuer
made no haste and paid no special attention
to the lop-shouldered one. It was as if he had
known in advance where his quarry would alight,
and when the dodging figure was lost finally
among the late roisterers still obstructing the
planked sidewalks, Plegg pushed on steadily until
he reached the corner occupied by Black Jack
Dargin&#8217;s gambling resort.</p>

<p>At the corner, the first assistant changed his
tactics suddenly. Flattening himself against the
side of the building he edged his way cautiously
down the short side street. Being the headquarters
of a leading industry, Dargin&#8217;s &#8220;place&#8221;
enjoyed the distinction of standing as the only
two-storied building in the camp. With its
ground floor devoted strictly to the business of
relieving restless or thirsty souls of the hard-earned
dollars, the second floor was the living
apartment of the master gambler. It was approached
by an outside stair, and up this stair
Plegg crept on his toes and finger-ends.</p>

<p>The door at the stair-head was closed, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
first assistant seemed to know his ground. Noiselessly
a skeleton key was slipped into the lock,
there was a faint click, and the door swung inward,
opening into a dark hall running crosswise
of the building. Again Plegg showed his familiarity
with his surroundings. Closing the door,
and thus shutting himself into the Egyptian darkness
of the narrow upper hall, he felt his way
carefully to the opposite end of the passage, found
and unlocked another door, and stepped out upon
a railed gallery running the full length of the
building at the second-story level. A few steps
to the right two windows and a door gave upon
the gallery, and the windows were lighted.</p>

<p>Once more resorting to the Indian tactics,
Plegg crouched in the shadow and worked his way
silently on hands and knees to the nearest window.
The shade was partly drawn down, but since the
night was unusually warm for the season and the
altitude the window was open a few inches at the
bottom.</p>

<p>The view from the gallery was unobstructed.
Plegg saw an interior gaudily furnished, a costly
carpet, ill-kept and soiled by muddied boots,
yellowed lace hangings at the windows, heavy
mahogany chairs, scarred and with their leather
upholstering chafed and abused, a marble-topped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
table littered with cigar stubs, an ash tray, a scattered
deck of cards and an open box of cigars;
the whole lighted by a hanging lamp with a cheap
tin reflector.</p>

<p>There were two men in the room and they sat
on opposite sides of the table. One was the master
gambler; he had selected the one wooden
chair in the room, and he sat back with his hands
in his pockets, rocking the chair gently on two
legs. He was in his shirt-sleeves, and the black,
Indian-like hair fell forward in a lock that shaded
the coldly staring eyes.</p>

<p>The other man was the &#8220;mucker&#8221; of the yard
watchman&#8217;s report, the man Plegg had been following.
On the Grillage pay-roll he appeared as
Simeon Backus, serving on the day shift as a muck
shoveler in the eastern heading of the great tunnel.
He sat in one of the upholstered chairs with
a deep seat, and his deformities&mdash;the lopped
shoulder and arms much too long for his body&mdash;were
accentuated. His face, with its lines half
obliterated by a ragged beard, lacked none of the
villainous characteristics of the ingrained criminal;
beady eyes that would look at nothing steadily,
a retreating chin, a thin-lipped, acrid mouth.</p>

<p>When Silas Plegg reached his spying place on
the gallery, Dargin was speaking.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>&#8220;Cut it out, Simmy; cut it all out and get
down to brass tacks!&#8221; he was growling. &#8220;Your
hard job in the tunnel isn&#8217;t any skin off of me; and
you get paid twice for it, at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What little rake-off you give me for steerin&#8217;
the money-burners down here don&#8217;t cut no ice with
me!&#8221; snapped the smaller man. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got bigger
game to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoot,&#8221; said Dargin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a line on the new boss. Did you
know he was down here lookin&#8217; you over the other
night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw him,&#8221; was the brief reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to run you out&mdash;clean up the
shop&mdash;wipe off the slate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who says he is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says so, by cripes! I&#8217;ve got it straight.
This here hell-hole&#8217;s got to be took off the map.
It&#8217;s bu&#8217;stin&#8217; up his gangs and robbin&#8217; his men, and
he ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to stand for no such. And say,
Jack&mdash;<i>he&#8217;s got the old geezer behind him</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grillage? Not in a thousand years, Simmy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you I got it straight. There&#8217;s a
skirt in it this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cough it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this-away; that young cock-o&#8217;-the-walk&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to marry Grillage&#8217;s daughter&mdash;see?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>&#8220;How do you know he is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t much that a bunch as big as ours
don&#8217;t know about its bosses&mdash;or that it can&#8217;t find
out if it tries. Vallory hadn&#8217;t hardly lit down on
the job before ever&#8217;body knew that he got his
boost from the inside&mdash;that it was all in the family.
Why, hell; he&#8217;s nothin&#8217; but an overgrowed
kid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk too many, Simmy,&#8221; was the gruff interruption.
&#8220;Get down to the face-cards and
aces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I will. Did you know Grillage is
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew he was coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s come&mdash;and he&#8217;s fetched the girl
with him. You know what she tried to get him
to do last fall, after Lushing was fool enough to
bring that look-see crowd down here from the
hotel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Dargin. &#8220;She tried to get the
old man to put the kibosh on us. He wouldn&#8217;t
do it then; and he isn&#8217;t going to back Vallory
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it! The girl will make
him back Vallory, if she feels like it. I&#8217;m tellin&#8217;
you again&mdash;I got it straight. The minute Vallory
hears she&#8217;s here, he makes a straight shoot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
for the hotel, and sits most o&#8217; the evenin&#8217; on the
porch with her. I kep&#8217; cases on &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t prove anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It proves what I&#8217;m sayin&#8217;. You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to
get the hook, Dargin, and I&#8217;m the one man that
can keep it out o&#8217; your liver.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silas Plegg, from his cramped spying place on
the gallery, saw a bleak smile flicker for a moment
in the cold eyes of the master gambler.</p>

<p>&#8220;You get your pay, don&#8217;t you, Simmy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For leggin&#8217; for your skin game down-stairs,
yes. But this time I&#8217;ve got somethin&#8217; to sell&mdash;somethin&#8217;
that Grillage&#8217;ll pay for, if you don&#8217;t
want it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you tell me what it is, Simmy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you this much: s&#8217;pose you could go to
Grillage and say, &#8216;Look-ee here, old sport; I&#8217;m
wise to somethin&#8217; that&#8217;ll knock all the money out
o&#8217; this railroad job o&#8217; yours, and then some; you
keep this here Vallory hook out o&#8217; me, and I&#8217;ll
keep mine out o&#8217; you.&#8217; How does that hit you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Plegg saw the vanishing smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get all this flim-flam dope,
Simmy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of it I&#8217;ve had a good little spell. The
rest of it I got to-night listenin&#8217; under the windows
of Vallory&#8217;s bunk car.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>&#8220;Who was doing the talking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three of &#8217;em, first and last: young Altman
and Vallory, and then Vallory and that gun-totin&#8217;
under-boss o&#8217; his&#8217;n, Plegg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Supposing I say that I&#8217;m not in the market;
then what?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lop-shouldered man struggled up in his
chair and spat his reply out viciously. &#8220;Then, by
cripes, I&#8217;ll go to Grillage himself! <i>He&#8217;ll</i> buy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Dargin softly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll sell this
thing to me or to Grillage, whichever one of us
bids the highest. Is that it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shoutin&#8217; now. I&#8217;m tired o&#8217; hidin&#8217; out
and dodgin&#8217; Hank Bullock in these dam&#8217; mountains.
Some o&#8217; these days he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to hike up
this-away and get the drop on me; and then&#8221;&mdash;the
misshapen man made a gesture pantomiming
the clicking of handcuffs upon wrists. &#8220;I want to
skip down yonder to Honduras, &#8217;r some o&#8217; them
places where they never heard o&#8217; me &#8217;r the croakin&#8217;
business in Gunnison. And you lissen to me, Jack;
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to have a wad big enough to stake me
when I get there, and don&#8217;t you forget it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The swarthy giant on the opposite side of the
table was still tilting his chair and still had his
hands deeply buried in his pockets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see if I&#8217;m getting it straight, Simmy,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
said gently. &#8220;You&#8217;ve thought it all out, and
you&#8217;re going to sell this thing you&#8217;ve got hold of&mdash;and
which you haven&#8217;t named for me yet&mdash;either
to me or to the big boss. If I get it, I can
make the hook miss; and if Grillage beats me to
it&mdash;what happens then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then Grillage plays safe on his profit by
gettin&#8217; me out o&#8217; the country; see? And then, if
Vallory wants to stick his fork into you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The man in the deep chair stopped short. The
other made no move. His dark face with its
leaden eyes and the heavy drooping mustaches
was as impassive as the face of the Buddha. The
lop-shouldered &#8220;mucker&#8221; seemed to be trying to
read the Buddha face, and when he failed he gave
a gulping swallow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I reckon I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; through my hat, Jack,&#8221;
he wavered. &#8220;Grillage ain&#8217;t in the deal; I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to sell my stock to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg, looking on at a distance of not more than
half the width of the room would have sworn that
no man of Dargin&#8217;s build could have moved so
swiftly. At one instant he was swaying gently in
the tilted chair. At the next he was leaning across
the table and thrusting the muzzle of a pistol
against the shrinking body of the talebearer.
When he spoke his voice was like the whistling of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
the north wind. &#8220;No, Simmy, you&#8217;re not going
to sell it to me; you&#8217;re going to <i>give</i> it to me,
<i>now</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>For possibly five minutes, as if the pressing pistol
muzzle were a magnet to electrify and hold
him rigid, Simeon Backus, ex-cattle rustler, ex-yeggman,
and now a manslayer hiding from justice,
sat erect and motionless, pouring forth a
stammering story. There was little in the story
that was new to the listening ear at the window.
Chiefly it was made up of the facts concerning the
weak roof in the tunnel&mdash;facts still unknown to
the railroad people; wherein lay their value to
one who could trade upon them. Plegg heard
Altman&#8217;s talk with Vallory repeated; then, almost
word for word, his own talk with Vallory, with
the emphasis laid upon the consequences which he,
himself, had predicted would follow any leakage
of the facts in Lushing&#8217;s direction.</p>

<p>Plegg waited until he was measurably certain
that he had heard all that Backus had to spill, and
when there were signs that the talebearer was
about to be released, he hastened to make his retreat,
retracing his steps through the dark cross
hall and locking the doors behind him with his
skeleton key. Safely down the outside stair and
afoot in the street he hesitated. The facts about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
the dangerous tunnel roof were no longer a secret
to be carefully guarded by the Grillage staff. They
were weapons in the hands of a man who would
use them instantly in his own behalf. There were
two ways in which they might be used. Dargin
might go to Grillage and buy the immunity which
the contractor-king would doubtless assure by
laying positive orders upon Vallory to let the
Powder Can man-traps alone. Or, if by some
unheard-of chance, Virginia Grillage could succeed
in swinging her father over to her side and
Vallory&#8217;s, Dargin could use his information to
make capital with Lushing, and at one stroke entrench
himself with the railroad management and&mdash;through
the loss which would be saddled upon
the Grillage company&mdash;square his account with
Vallory.</p>

<p>All this the first assistant saw, and saw clearly,
in the momentary halt made upon the street corner.
Holding his watch in the light streaming
from the windows of the Dargin bar-room he
found that it stiff lacked a few minutes of eleven.
There was a chance and he took it, walking rapidly
up the street toward the place where, a few nights
before, he had drawn aside to become charitably
blind and deaf while David Vallory was talking
to Judith Fallon.</p>

Plegg&#8217;s Back-Fire</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR good and sufficient reasons Silas Plegg
did not wish to show himself in the dance-hall
opposite the Murtrie Mine ore sheds. On
all accounts he would have been glad to be assured
that he had thus far gone unrecognized through
the ill-lighted Powder Can street. Standing before
the wide-open doors of this other outreaching
of Dargin&#8217;s, he could pass the shuffling dancers in
review. The woman he was looking for was not
among them, and neither was she at the piano.</p>

<p>Turning away with a sigh of relief he crossed
the street, circled the ore sheds, and came upon
the row of shack cottages belonging to the Murtrie
company. Only one of the cottages showed
a lighted window, and here, again, Plegg made
careful reconnaissance before he knocked on the
door. It was Judith Fallon who opened to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8217;tis you, is it?&#8221; she said, when the light
fell upon him. &#8220;If it&#8217;s my father you&#8217;re wanting,
he&#8217;ll be over at the mine. &#8217;Tis his week to be on
the night shift.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to see your father, Judith,&#8221;
he said quietly. &#8220;I came to see you. May I
come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>The black eyes snapped and their light was
unfriendly. &#8220;&#8217;Tis an honor to the likes of me.
The door is open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg accepted the scant welcome and went
in. The interior of the cottage was plain almost
to poverty. Since the young woman would not
sit down he was forced to plunge bluntly into his
errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to you, Judith, because I am David
Vallory&#8217;s friend,&#8221; he began. &#8220;Have I made a
mistake?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her attitude was still antagonistic. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t be worrying,&#8221; she snapped. &#8220;I know my
place. &#8217;Tis not I that will be running after Davie
Vallory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You misunderstood me completely,&#8221; he hastened
to say. And then: &#8220;Won&#8217;t you please sit
down?&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved toward the lighted window. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
better that I don&#8217;t&mdash;and that you don&#8217;t,&#8221; she flung
out; and Plegg was quick to take the hint. She
was expecting some one else, and the some one
would doubtless be Dargin, the man who had constituted
himself her protector.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a chance, Judith&mdash;for Vallory&#8217;s
sake,&#8221; he thrust in boldly. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you do the
same?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis himself would kill you if he found you
here. But what is it you&#8217;ll want to be saying
about Davie?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was neither time nor opportunity for a
guarded approach to his object, and Plegg plunged
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Judith: Black Jack has just been told
something that gives him a strangle hold on Vallory;
if he uses it, it will cost Vallory his place on
this job, to say the least. I&#8217;m not saying that
Dargin wouldn&#8217;t be justified, from his own point
of view. Vallory would clean up these Powder
Can joints if he had the authority&mdash;which he
hasn&#8217;t, and won&#8217;t have. But he has said he would,
and Dargin knows it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How would Jack be using this thing that you
haven&#8217;t tied a name to?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;By passing it on to Lushing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That black-hearted devil!&#8221; she burst out.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis little but the back of my hand that I&#8217;m owing
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg saw his opening and drove the wedge
promptly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>&#8220;We all know Lushing,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you probably
have good reasons for hating him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reasons, it is? Do you know what he&#8217;d be
doing to me? For shame I can&#8217;t tell you. But
if Jack Dargin had listened to him, it&#8217;s not here
that I&#8217;d be, keeping house for my father!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dargin wants to marry you?&#8221; said Plegg
quickly.</p>

<p>The woman&#8217;s hard black eyes grew suddenly
tender. &#8220;&#8217;Tis not all bad he is, Mr. Plegg. Show
me the man like him that would do what he&#8217;s
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg had never faced a problem requiring
swifter or more skilful handling. In the very
nature of it he had to take much for granted; to
assume the values of the unknown quantities where
he could not demonstrate them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew Vallory before you came here,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Her eyes fell. &#8220;I grew up with him&mdash;in Middleboro.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg smiled. It was easier now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to ask you why you refused to
talk with him the other night; we&#8217;ll let that go.
I&#8217;m going to leave this thing with you, Judith.
David Vallory stands to get a knife in the back.
Jim Lushing will do the stabbing, but it will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
Dargin who will hand him the knife. Your
woman&#8217;s heart will tell you what to do, and how
to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands. &#8220;I can&#8217;t&mdash;<i>I
can&#8217;t!</i>&#8221; she shuddered. &#8220;Himself would kill
me, and I&#8217;d not be blaming him&mdash;after what he&#8217;s
done for me in this place. Think of what you&#8217;d
be asking me to do&mdash;to put the double-cross on
the one man who would be caring anything for
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg caught his breath and took his last long
leap in the dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dargin is Dargin,&#8221; he said, speaking slowly,
&#8220;but&mdash;you love David Vallory, Judith. That&#8217;s
all I had to say; good-night.&#8221; And he opened
the door and vanished.</p>

<p>Having thus done his best to avert a possible
tragedy&mdash;at the possible cost of another tragedy&mdash;the
first assistant owned but one pressing anxiety,
namely, to get out of the mining-camp speedily,
and without stumbling upon some one of the
late-hour stragglers who might recognize him.</p>

<p>Leaving the Fallon cottage, he was at first
minded to climb the steep slope of Gold Hill, thus
making his exit without passing again through the
town street. But the night was dark, and there
was no path over the hill shoulder that he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
recall. Dismissing the alternative, he faced about
to return as he had come; but before he had taken
a dozen steps toward the street the lights of the
dance-hall opposite showed him a man turning
the corner at the ore sheds and coming toward
him.</p>

<p>Though the distance was too great and the light
too uncertain to enable him to identify the man,
there could be little doubt that it was Dargin.
Judith Fallon had shown plainly that she was expecting
him. Instantly Plegg realized that there
were likely to be consequences if Dargin should
meet him. The Fallon house was the only one in
the shack-cottage group that showed any signs of
life, and Dargin would be swift to draw conclusions.
But there was even a greater danger than
this to be feared. Plegg had left Judith Fallon
in tears, wrestling with the sharpest problem that
can confront any woman, gentle or simple. If
Dargin should find her thus, and before she was
given time to compose herself....</p>

<p>Plegg&#8217;s hand flew to his hip pocket and his resolve
was taken. Of the two evils he would
choose that which seemed to be the lesser. Half-way
down the little hill he met the master gambler
and blocked his path. Dargin stopped and thrust
his head forward for a better sight of the obstructionist.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
Then: &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, is it? What the
hell&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was looking for you, Dargin,&#8221; Plegg said
promptly, turning fugitive expectation into aggressive
fact. Then he added the whole-cloth lie.
&#8220;Somebody said I&#8217;d find you at John Fallon&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now that you&#8217;ve found me, what of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>It may be imagined that never, in a life-time
that had not been in any manner devoid of exciting
moments, had Silas Plegg been more sorely put
to it to fill a suddenly yawning gap. But at any
cost time must be gained.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a personal matter, Dargin,&#8221; he explained
coolly. &#8220;Word has been passed in camp that
you&#8217;re out gunning for Vallory. I&#8217;d like to believe
that it&#8217;s nothing but camp gossip; some of
the hard-boiled eggs talking just to make a noise.
How about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What business is it of yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m making it my business, Jack. Vallory&#8217;s
my boss and my friend. He isn&#8217;t a gun-toter, and
you know it. He&#8217;d stand just about as much show
with you as these pick-and-shovel men do betting
against your faro-game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t said I was after him, have I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to me, you haven&#8217;t. And I don&#8217;t ask
you either to say it or deny it. All I want to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
is this: if you go gunning for Vallory, you&#8217;ve got
to include me. You understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>The giant grunted. &#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;d like to try
it out right now?&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; said Plegg calmly. &#8220;I&#8217;m
heeled, and I know you are. If you think you can
get to it quicker than I can, the bars are down.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time the &#8220;killer&#8217;s&#8221; grunt lapsed into a
chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need a man for breakfast to-morrow
morning,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When I do, I&#8217;ll let you
know. S&#8217;pose you get out o&#8217; the way and let me
pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure,&#8221; snapped Plegg. &#8220;Only what
I say, goes. If you hit Vallory, you hit me. And
it will be safer if you hit me first, and you always
know where to find me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith&#8217;s saving interval having thus been bought
and paid for, Plegg stood aside and let Dargin
have the path. But after he had left the town
behind and was plodding across the basin on his
way back to the headquarters camp and his long-deferred
rest, he was weighing judicially the value
of the expedient to which he had resorted. To
which extreme of the arc would the pendulum of a
woman&#8217;s emotions be carried? Would Judith
Fallon be true to whatever feeling she still cherished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
for David Vallory? Or would she refuse
to betray the man who, so far as his limitations
had permitted, had stood between her and utter
degradation?</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s on the knees of the gods,&#8221; was the
first assistant&#8217;s final summing-up of the matter;
the conclusion reached as he was crossing the yard
tracks to the isolated bunk car. &#8220;There may be
some man living who can tell what a woman will
do under given conditions, but the good Lord
knows I&#8217;m not that man.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so leaving it he swung up the steps of the
car and crept to his bunk, quietly, so as not to disturb
his sleeping chief.</p>

Master and Man</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the day following the arrival of Mr. Grillage&#8217;s
private car at Powder Gap, word
was passed from camp to camp that the big boss
was about to make an inspection round with the
new chief of construction, and the activities automatically
speeded themselves up to grace the occasion.</p>

<p>At the bridge sites the clank and grind of the
concrete mixers, the upshoot and dumping tip of
the hoist buckets, and the clattering descent of the
concrete into the forms played the industrial quick-step.
In the hill cuttings the intermittent clamor
of steam-shovels and the strident exhausts of locomotives
dragging the spoil to the fills made deafening
discords. In the short tunnel under Dead
Man&#8217;s Ridge the hard-rock men timed their forenoon
blasts accurately to make a thunderous crash
of dynamite salute the upcoming of the light engine
and way-car bearing President Grillage and
his chief engineer.</p>

<p>So far as any routine-changing result was concerned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
the inspection trip was conspicuously barren.
It was rather a triumphal progress for the
new chief. At each stopping-place the big boss
climbed down dutifully from the way-car to look
on and listen while David explained some new
method of cost-cutting, and there was always the
word of gruff approval, coupled with the suggestion
that they move along.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m taking all your little economies and short-cuttings
for granted, David,&#8221; said the tamed
tyrant, as the way-car special shot around the
curves of approach to the main tunnel. &#8220;I got it
pretty straight from Coulee du Sac that you were
up in all the late kinks in money-saving and systematizing.
You are doing good work, and I&#8217;m
right proud of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again David&#8217;s heart warmed to the big man
who had been so grossly misrepresented as a hard
boss. Thus far, there had been no single word of
criticism; nothing but hearty appreciation and
praise. David knew well enough that his work
couldn&#8217;t be beyond criticism; that to a master
workman as experienced as Eben Grillage the
shortcomings must surely be apparent. Yet there
had been nothing said that would lead him to believe
that the contractor-king was making anything
but the most perfunctory duty trip over the job.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>At the tunnel portal they found Plegg, who was
apparently waiting for them. There was a halt
of a few minutes while the first assistant, in obedience
to a signal which David was not permitted to
see, held his chief to ask some routine question
about a proposed re-sloping of the approach cutting.
Eben Grillage walked on into the tunnel
alone. The great black bore was lighted only by
a string of inadequate electric bulbs hung at hundred-foot
intervals, and the massive figure of the
president was soon lost to view in the depths.
David Vallory answered Plegg&#8217;s queries impatiently,
the more so because they seemed to be
peculiarly trivial and ill-timed. It was something
less than respectful to allow the president to go
stumbling into the tunnel unattended.</p>

<p>When they finally overtook him the big boss
had penetrated to the working heading, and was
looking on quietly while the drillers and their helpers
removed the drill-columns and prepared for a
blast. Again there were words commendatory of
the discipline and the industrial systematizing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; was Eben Grillage&#8217;s comment, when
David came up with Plegg at his elbow. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
losing you two fellows to the efficiency squad one
of these fine days; that&#8217;s a fact.&#8221; Then to the
black-eyed, black-mustached little French-Canadian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
who had taken Altman&#8217;s place: &#8220;Hello,
Regnier! So they&#8217;ve got you on the mole job,
now, have they?&#8221;</p>

<p>Regnier came across to join the onlooking
group.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eet is moz&#8217; in&#8217;ospitable, but in five minute ze
men will fire ze blast,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Me, I am
<i>d&eacute;sol&eacute;</i> to &#8217;ave to h&#8217;ask you zhentlemen to go h&#8217;out,
<i>mais</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;d better go out if we don&#8217;t want to get
our necks stretched, eh?&#8221; laughed the visiting
overlord. &#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Regnier; we&#8217;ve seen
all we need to, I guess.&#8221; And the retreat was
made so hurriedly that David had no chance to
inspect the dangerous spot in the roof, or to call
the president&#8217;s attention to it, as he had fully intended
doing.</p>

<p>These were the commonplace incidents of the
day of inspections, and there were no other kind.
But when the day was ended, and David Vallory
was once more finding a reward for duty done in
an ecstatic hour with Virginia on the Inn porch,
it is conceivable that the joy-nerve might have lost
some of its thrills if he could have been endowed
with the gift of double personality, enabling him
to see and hear what was transpiring coincidently
in the Grillage private Pullman at the foot of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
ridge. In the open central compartment of the
car Plegg was once more under fire, and the special
target of the bombardment was his estimate of
the bad roof in tunnel heading Number One.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are losing your sand, Plegg, the same as
young Altman did,&#8221; Grillage was asserting bluntly.
&#8220;I took the chance you made for me this morning
and had a good look at that &#8216;fault&#8217; while you were
holding Vallory at the portal. In spite of your
test-borings, and all that you&#8217;ve had to say about
it, I say the roof will stay up while we&#8217;re driving.
If the railroad company wants to concrete it after
we&#8217;re through, that&#8217;s a horse of another color.
We&#8217;re not hunting for a chance to throw good
money away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Plegg, almost humbly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you manage to get Altman out and
Regnier in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The change was made to-day and Vallory authorized
it. Altman went over my head last night
and took his complaint to Vallory, though I had
warned him not to. A little later Vallory fell
upon me and wanted to know why I hadn&#8217;t ordered
the weak spot timbered. I smoothed it
over as well as I could; gave him a hint of the
use Lushing might make of it if we should advertise
the weak spot by timbering it. He saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
point after a while and told me to shift Altman
and put Regnier in. But I had to lie to him to
bring it about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bosh! That roof isn&#8217;t coming down. You&#8217;ve
been letting Altman&#8217;s nerves put one across on
yours!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was just here that the first assistant took his
courage in both hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what I know; and you know it, as well,
Mr. Grillage,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The test drillings
showed up the conditions plainly enough, as I
wrote you at the time. That entire crevice is filled
with loose material that is certain to come down,
sooner or later. Why not go to the railroad
people frankly, show them what we&#8217;re up against,
and try to persuade them to let us concrete that
break on force account, with the cost of doing it
added to our estimate?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eben Grillage&#8217;s answer to this was brutally
direct.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m running the business end of this company&#8217;s
affairs, Plegg, and when I want your help I&#8217;ll call
on you. But since you&#8217;ve gone this far, I&#8217;ll tell
you a thing or two. Lushing hasn&#8217;t been idle
since he climbed over the fence into the railroad
pasture. He&#8217;s been building prejudice against us
to beat the band. If we&#8217;d make the break you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
suggest, I wouldn&#8217;t put it beyond him to claim that
we&#8217;d shaken that roof up purposely with dynamite
to get an excuse to run a force account job in on
them. Such things have been done, on other jobs,
and I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if Lushing had helped do
some of &#8217;em. No; our safe play is to let sleeping
dogs lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if somebody should take the trouble to
wake this particular dog?&#8221; Plegg put in quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put Lushing on?&#8221; queried the big man at the
desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The bad roof is an open secret. The men in
the tunnel shifts all know about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But none of our men will go to Lushing.
They hate him too well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one other man who knows about it,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Black Jack Dargin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! How did he find out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That door is pretty wide open, isn&#8217;t it? A
good many of the hard-rock men blow their
money in Dargin&#8217;s dives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure he knows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, quite sure.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>&#8220;He&#8217;d sell the tip to Lushing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg shook his head. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t believe
he&#8217;d sell it. But he might give it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spit it all out&mdash;don&#8217;t beat around the bush,
Plegg! What&#8217;s the inside of the deal? You
know more than you&#8217;re willing to tell, and that
isn&#8217;t a safe play for you to make at me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg ignored the implication and the threat
and answered only the direct question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the inside of the deal. But one
man&#8217;s guess is as good as another&#8217;s. Lushing
goes all the gaits in Powder Can; he did it while
he was with us, and he does it now, when he&#8217;s here.
I&#8217;ve thought, more than once, that he might have
some sort of a stand-in with Dargin. As the
matter stands now, Dargin can give us away any
time he feels like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>As was his habit when he was putting his back
to the wall in any fight, Eben Grillage caught up
the paper-knife from his desk and began to test
the edge of it with a spatulate thumb.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to get at the inwards of this
thing,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;David was saying something
last night about wanting to clean out the
Powder Can messes. Dargin is going to hold this
tunnel business as a club. Vallory mustn&#8217;t meddle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
with the nuisances; you must see to it that he
doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vallory doesn&#8217;t take &#8216;seeing to&#8217; very submissively.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right; you keep him from meddling
with Dargin&#8217;s affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t consider my suggestion about making
a clean breast of the tunnel situation to Mr.
Ford? As I&#8217;ve said, I am firmly convinced that
the stuff in the crevice will come down, sooner or
later. If it slides while we are still driving the
heading, no man who happens to be behind it will
get out alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want your suggestion&mdash;or your convictions
either, for that matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. It is your risk and you see fit to
take it. I have nothing more to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the risk. Have you stopped the
calamity talk among the men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the time being, yes. I raised the pay of
the shift bosses, and told them what it was for.
That is all in the game, and I&#8217;m crooked enough
by this time not to mind an additional bit of bribery.
But there is one thing that I&#8217;ve said before,
and I&#8217;ll say it again: it&#8217;s a damned shame to hoodwink
a fine young fellow like Vallory the way I&#8217;ve
been doing ever since he came on the job. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
has no idea that we are not playing square with the
railroad people; none whatever. And it&#8217;s just as
I told you last night; if a smash should come, it
will hit him harder than it will anybody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take care of all the smashes,&#8221; growled
the tyrant, who was no longer tame. &#8220;All you
have to do is to keep your mouth shut and go on
sawing wood. You know very well why I want
Vallory kept in the dark; or at least, you know the
business reason, anyway. He is valuable on this
job only so long as he <i>is</i> kept in the dark. You
are the man to do it, Plegg, and you&#8217;ve got it to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg&#8217;s thin lips curled in a dog-like grimace.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t do it, you&#8217;ll revive that old criminal
charge against me on the Falling Water dam and
get me jugged&mdash;the charge that made me the
scapegoat for the use of rotten cement when you
and your man Homer were the responsible people,&#8221;
he said bitterly. &#8220;I know perfectly well
where I stand with you&mdash;and with the courts&mdash;Mr.
Grillage. But there are limits. One of
these days I may decide to tell you to go to hell&mdash;and
take whatever may be coming to me. Vallory
trusts me and I am abusing his confidence
every day and resorting to all kinds of shifts to
keep him from finding out the thousand-and-one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
crooked things we&#8217;re doing to beat the specifications
on this job. You say I know the business
reason why he was sent out here, but I don&#8217;t.
Why you wanted to put a clean young fellow like
David Vallory in charge of this job is beyond me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re duller than usual to-night, Plegg, and
that&#8217;s needless,&#8221; was the tyrant&#8217;s unfeeling retort.
&#8220;The chief reason is that David has put some capital
into this thing. President Ford knows Adam
Vallory, and the Vallory connections generally.
We&#8217;re capitalizing that knowledge. But that&#8217;s a
side issue. Coming back to this tunnel business:
we&#8217;re into it and we&#8217;ve got to go through with it.
The secret of that &#8216;rotten spot,&#8217; as you insist upon
calling it, must be kept quiet so far as the railroad
people are concerned. Jack Dargin must keep it,
too, if you have to go and buy him outright.
Lushing will be out here in a few days, loaded for
bear. He has given it out cold that he is going to
do us up, and he wouldn&#8217;t ask for any better
chance than this tunnel roof tempest in a teapot
would give him. You may go now; that will be
all for to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at this precise moment, when Plegg was
leaving the private Pullman in the construction
yard, that David Vallory was asking the daughter
of profitable contracts a pointed question.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>&#8220;Is there ever such a thing as a middle course
between absolute right and absolute wrong, Vinnie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a question!&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;Is that
what you&#8217;ve been thinking about all this time that
you&#8217;ve been letting me do the talking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;d like to know,&#8221; he persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I imagine you have as much common sense,
and rather more conscience, than most men, David.
Why do you ask me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I know you are honest, and altogether
fearless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So are you,&#8221; she returned quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I was once, I think; but, somehow,
things are changing for me. The old anchorages
are slipping away, and I can&#8217;t seem to find any new
ones. For example: I did a thing last night
which seems perfectly justifiable on one side, and
almost criminal on the other. I&#8217;ve been trying
all day to make up my mind as to whether I ought
to pat myself on the back, or go to jail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you should tell me what you did, perhaps I
might be able to help your common sense, or your
conscience, or whatever it is that is involved,&#8221; she
suggested.</p>

<p>David glanced at his watch. The hour was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
late, and there were but few of the Inn guests
remaining on the porches.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m keeping you up,&#8221; he said shortly. &#8220;Some
day, perhaps, I&#8217;ll take the lid off and let you see
the tangle inside of me; but it&#8217;s too late to begin on
as big a job as that to-night. Are you going to let
me show you over the plant to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else is there for me to do in this wilderness
of a place?&#8221; she asked in mock despair. &#8220;I
shall most probably tag you around like a meddlesome
little boy until you&#8217;ll be glad to put me on the
train and send me home.&#8221;</p>

<p>David was still holding the hand of leave-taking.
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t go home until I send you,
you&#8217;ll stay here a long time,&#8221; he said happily.
And then he went his way, forgetting, in this newest
prospect of joy, the troublesome underthought
which had been growing, like an ominous threat,
around the incident of the talk with Altman, and
its outcome.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVII<br />


The Tar-Barrel</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN any descent to Avernus it is not often given
to the wayfarer to recognize the point at
which he first begins to go down-hill. In the removal
of the careful Altman from the eastern
tunnel boring and the substituting of the reckless,
devil-may-care Regnier, David Vallory had succeeded
in persuading himself that he had merely
checked off an item in the day&#8217;s work, and was far
enough from suspecting that the item figured as
another milestone in the downward inclining path.</p>

<p>But certain results followed in due course, and
a growth, not in grace. For one of the results,
David, being a shrewd-eyed master of his trade,
soon began to discover many of the things that
Plegg was trying to hide from him&mdash;the dishonesties
large and small by which unscrupulous Business
seeks to increase the margin or profit; to
discover them and pass by on the other side with
closed eyes. Another result was his changed and
changing attitude toward the Powder Can nuisance.
From regarding the wide-open mining-camp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
chiefly as a moral menace, he was beginning
to look upon it more as an obstacle to progress&mdash;his
own industrial progress on the job. It was
sapping the strength of his working force, and
therefore&mdash;in spite of the contractor-king&#8217;s injunction,
which he took to be another of the little
kindnesses designed to make things easier for him&mdash;it
was to be abolished.</p>

<p>In the field of the discovered dishonesties and
the closed eye, effect succeeded to cause with due
celerity. The conditions on a well-systematized
undertaking like the line-shortening project are
fairly telepathic. Almost immediately it began
to be whispered about among the gang bosses and
the men that the new chief was bent upon making
a record; the first assistant said so, and the first
assistant ought to know. This being the fact, the
bridle might be taken off&mdash;always with due regard
for the railroad watch-dogs, and for a decent concealment
from a chief who, for the look of the
thing, must be in a position to say that he knew
nothing whatever of cast-off bridles and the substitution
of loose halters therefor.</p>

<p>When David Vallory began to realize that his
lowering of the standards was taken as an ell for
an inch by his subordinates and the rank and file,
it may be supposed that he was frankly appalled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
But momentum counts for something. And back
of the push on the downward slide there was always
the debt of obligation owed to Eben Grillage.
The king of the contractors might be all that men
said he was; a hard bargain driver and a cold-blooded
buccaneer of business. But at the same
time he was Virginia&#8217;s father and the savior of the
Vallory good name.</p>

<p>If these were the inner wrestlings, David had as
yet shared them with no one. Outwardly, at least
on the social side, he was measuring up to a rather
exacting standard set by Miss Virginia. Days
in which he took her on the construction locomotives
and put her in touch with the throbbings of
the feverish heart of the activities were intermingled
with summer evenings on the Alta Vista
porches. For some cause as yet unexplained, the
coming of his father and sister was delayed; and
for some other cause, into which his infatuation
forbade him to inquire, no one of Virginia Grillage&#8217;s
retinue of suitors had thus far intruded upon
the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;And still you are not entirely happy,&#8221; she
laughed, one evening, when he spoke of the comforting
dearth of the suitors.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think I&#8217;m not happy?&#8221; he
shot back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>&#8220;I can tell. You have something on your
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made an attempt to turn her aside from the
topic of the mind-burdens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I had you to myself for days and
days? I don&#8217;t know what more a man could ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that!&#8221; she mocked. &#8220;But, just the same,
you&#8217;re not happy.&#8221; Then she added, apparently
as an after-thought: &#8220;And neither am I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me it is because you are missing the
others,&#8221; he pleaded, still intent upon warding off
the more personal personalities.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am missing them dreadfully; especially Lord
Cumberleigh and little Freddy Wishart. But
mostly it&#8217;s your ingratitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My ingratitude?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I said. In the kiddie days you
used to tell me everything. But now you are shutting
me out. You lead me along just so far, but
beyond that I find myself talking to another David,
one that I know less and less every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a time he was silent. Then he said: &#8220;You
are altogether right&mdash;as you always are, Vinnie.
There <i>is</i> another David; a man that I am trying
mighty hard to get acquainted with, myself. I
don&#8217;t know him well enough yet to introduce him
to you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>&#8220;That sounds almost uncanny. Is it meant to
be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is uncanny. I can&#8217;t account for it&mdash;or him&mdash;or
wholly approve him. This other David isn&#8217;t
always a pleasant person to meet. Part of the
time I seem to recognize him in a vague sort of
way, and then again he becomes a total stranger;
a man of moods and impulses and perfectly barbarous
leanings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she said quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen him
now and then. I saw him to-day when we were
down at the Cross Gulch bridge. The foreman
had apparently been doing something that you had
told him not to do. You didn&#8217;t rave at him, but
for a second or two the other David looked out
through your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you account for it&mdash;or him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I be able to account for it&mdash;or
him&mdash;if you can&#8217;t? Of course, there are always
general principles. If a watch has been keeping
good time and begins to go wrong, it is a sign that
some one has been tinkering with the works, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you would suggest that some one has been
tinkering with my works?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that you are different&mdash;and that I am
sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>&#8220;Have I been different this evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, part of the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is some little cause for the added grouch
just now. I&#8217;ve been neglecting a plain duty.
Did you notice the thinness of the gangs working
on the lower section when we were down there
to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not particularly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were thin. Yesterday was pay-day,
and a lot of those hand-to-mouth &#8216;wops&#8217; are blowing
themselves in Powder Can. When I first
came here I saw that that mining-camp would
have to be cleaned up, but I&#8217;ve been putting it off.
Out of the goodness of his heart, your father tells
me to let it alone; he&#8217;d rather take his losses than
to have me shoulder another load, I suppose.
But the thing has reached the limit. I&#8217;m going
after it with a sharp stick.&#8221;</p>

<p>On this particular evening they were sitting on
the western porch, a bit withdrawn, as usual, from
the groups of idling summer people. At the end
of the porch a low-branching fir grew so close to
the building that its nearer twigs, swayed by the
gentle breeze sliding down from the heights of
Qojogo, made little tapping sounds to break the
silence of the mountain night. Under the low-hanging
branches of the fir the big St. Bernard belonging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
to the hotel proprietor was curled up; at
least David Vallory thought it was the dog&mdash;had
reason to think so since it was the St. Bernard&#8217;s
nightly sleeping-place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something ought to be done,&#8221; was the young
woman&#8217;s agreement with the sharp-stick suggestion.
&#8220;How will you go about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at this conjuncture that the sleeping dog
stirred uneasily, but David Vallory did not look
aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man named Dargin is the head and front of
things over there. If he were run out, the smaller
fellows could be handled without much trouble.
I&#8217;ve been hesitating between two methods of
getting at Dargin. I suppose the simplest plan
would be to walk over there some day and tell him
that he can have twenty-four hours in which to settle
up his affairs and vanish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Virginia&#8217;s exclamation was a little shriek.
&#8220;The idea!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do you suppose he
would go away for anything like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would if it were properly backed up; if I
should tell him, for example, that if I had the job
to do over, I&#8217;d do it with a gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy me! This is the &#8216;other David&#8217; with a
vengeance! Do you really mean it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I mean it? If the argument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
of force is the only one that would appeal to
him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;d be killed! I&#8217;ve heard the most
awful stories of this man. He wouldn&#8217;t give you
the slightest chance. Promise me that you won&#8217;t
do any such recklessly foolish thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t, if you don&#8217;t want me to; though it&#8217;s
much the simpler way to go about it. The other
way is to write a personal letter to President Ford
of the railroad company. I don&#8217;t know him,
but my father does, and he is a good man&mdash;a
clean man. I am practically certain that if he
knew the conditions he&#8217;d use the railroad company&#8217;s
power to clean up the camp&mdash;the power
given it by the land leases. But that is enough
about the job and me and my little insanities. I
must hike back down the hill to my blankets.
I know you&#8217;d be yawning if you were not too
polite.&#8221;</p>

<p>She got up to walk with him to the porch steps,
and at the good-night moment he said: &#8220;Where
are you going to let me take you to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I pick the place I&#8217;m going to ask you
once more why you have been so persistently refusing
to take me to the big tunnel. Don&#8217;t you
know that I simply adore tunnels?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now David had his own good reasons for not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
having taken Eben Grillage&#8217;s quick-witted daughter
into the big bore where Regnier was driving
his hard-rock crews. Day by day the dangerous
&#8216;fault&#8217; was scattering its warnings in chips and
spallings of fresh rock thrown down from the disintegrating
roof&mdash;evidences which Regnier was
careful to remove before they should attract the
attention of the railroad inspectors.</p>

<p>&#8220;A tunnel in process of construction isn&#8217;t a good
place in which to entertain inquisitive little girls,&#8221;
David evaded. &#8220;And this particular tunnel is wet
and mucky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the reason why you haven&#8217;t taken
me there,&#8221; she asserted calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know it isn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I was in the tunnel this afternoon.
You had been making so many foolish excuses that
my curiosity was aroused. I took advantage of
your absence at the other end of things and made
Mr. Plegg take me. He didn&#8217;t want to; he was
just as gruff and impossible as he dared to be to
the big boss&#8217;s daughter. But I made him do
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is easily conceivable that David felt cold chills
racing up and down his spine at the bare thought
of what might have happened during this unauthorized
visit&mdash;this, be it remarked, though he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
fancied he had settled it definitely with himself
that nothing was going to happen.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was altogether wrong!&#8221; he said, in his
best workmanlike manner. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know you
shouldn&#8217;t break discipline that way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poof!&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;That is what Cumberleigh
would call &#8216;putting on side&#8217;. It&#8217;s a pity
if I have to ask permission when I wish to go
somewhere&mdash;and of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head in despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not a bit less wilful than you used to
be in the old Middleboro days. But, really, Vinnie,
you mustn&#8217;t go into the tunnel again. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s
no place for visitors, or at least for women
visitors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a reason for saying that, and it isn&#8217;t
any of those you&#8217;ve been giving me,&#8221; she flashed
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221; He had not yet reached
the point at which he could lie to her deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it. You haven&#8217;t any scruples about letting
me get mucky and grimy on any other part
of the work; you have rather enjoyed telling me
that my face needed washing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never, unless it did,&#8221; he laughed, hoping to
find some way of diverting the talk from the unwelcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
tunnel channel. But Miss Virginia, with
an end in view, was not of those who may be easily
turned aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there was Mr. Silas Plegg,&#8221; she went on.
&#8220;I have had a good many escorts, first and last&mdash;and
some of them unwilling, no doubt&mdash;but Mr.
Plegg capped the climax. He was as nervous as
a cat after we got inside, and if I didn&#8217;t know him
so well, I should say he acted as if he were afraid
of something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was,&#8221; Plegg&#8217;s chief confirmed grimly. &#8220;I
have given positive orders that no one, other than
those connected with the working shifts, be admitted
to the tunnel headings. Plegg knew he
would be in for a bawling-out when I should find
out what he&#8217;d done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young woman&#8217;s smile was a mocking little
grimace.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t at all that kind of &#8216;afraid&#8217;; it seemed
to me more like just plain scare. While we were
watching the drills, Mr. Regnier pulled him aside
and spoke to him. They probably thought the
drills were making such a clatter that I couldn&#8217;t
hear what they said; but I <i>did</i> hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cuss-words?&#8221; David suggested. He was still
trying to maintain the good-naturedly playful attitude.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>She nodded vigorously. &#8220;Perfectly hair-raising!&#8221;
she assured him. &#8220;Mr. Regnier said, &#8216;Why
in the&#8217;&mdash;a long string of sizzling things&mdash;&#8216;do you
bring her here? Have you not of the senses the&mdash;blinkety-blank-blank&mdash;smallest
portion?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t hear what excuse Mr. Plegg made,
but it was evidently not a very good one, for Mr.
Regnier broke loose again: &#8216;<i>Sacre bleu!</i> you are
prip-pare to get yourself deeslike. <i>Hein!</i> you
shall chase her out of here so queek as <i>le bon Dieu</i>
will let you!&#8217; You spoke of discipline a minute
ago. I shouldn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d allow one of the
under-assistants to talk that way to your second
in command. It&#8217;s disgraceful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Answering the disciplinary gibe, David sought
once more to stave off the tunnel climax&mdash;if so be
the breaker of discipline were working toward a
climax. But again Miss Virginia proved herself
a true inheritor of the Grillage obstinacies and
persistences.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something the matter with that tunnel,
David, and I want to know what it is,&#8221; she
urged gravely.</p>

<p>He told a half-truth merely because no plausible
or practicable falsehood suggested itself at the
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a bit dangerous&mdash;in one place.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>&#8220;But if it is dangerous for me it is dangerous
for the workmen. Why don&#8217;t you timber the bad
place?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;What do you know about timbering
tunnels?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget that I&#8217;ve been eating the bread of
the construction camps all my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so; I had forgotten.&#8221; In their excursions
together over the job it had given him a glow
of superecstasy to find that she was familiar with
many of the details of her father&#8217;s trade&mdash;and his
own; details which would have been purest Greek
to most women. Silas Plegg&#8217;s commendation was
amply borne out by the fact; she was, indeed, &#8220;a
pretty good little engineer, herself.&#8221; None the
less his lips were sealed in the matter of tunnel-timbering&mdash;or
the lack of it. He could not tell
her that, for the sake of her father&#8217;s profit account,
the weak roof must not be timbered.
Hence, he temporized.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I shouldn&#8217;t have called it dangerous;
it isn&#8217;t so bad as you may be imagining. Timbering
is an obstruction to the work, and we always
get along without it if we can.&#8221; Then, resolute
to shelve the subject so high that it couldn&#8217;t be
reached again: &#8220;What has become of your father?
I haven&#8217;t seen him for two or three days.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>&#8220;He is down at the car to-night. But he hasn&#8217;t
been well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not well? I can&#8217;t think of him as not being
well. He always looks to me as if he&#8217;d never
known what it was to be sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t known very often, and for that
reason he never takes any care of himself. But
something over a year ago he scared me silly; he
had a touch of apoplexy. The doctors told me,
but they wouldn&#8217;t tell him. He got well in almost
no time, but since, I&#8217;ve been trying to make him
take things easy. That was one reason why I insisted
on coming out here with him this summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He needs a complete rest,&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and maybe he&#8217;ll get one when your father
comes. By the way&mdash;when are they coming&mdash;your
father and Lucille?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See how association with you makes me forget
things!&#8221; he jested. &#8220;I knew I had something to
tell you. They will be here to-morrow. I had
a letter this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ready for them?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are to have that cottage over there under
the pines, and they can take their meals here in the
hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a perfect summer night, with the stars
burning like beacon-lights in the inverted bowl of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
the heavens, a crescent moon hanging low over the
saw-tooth outline of Qojogo, and the elevated
backgrounds sweeping in the blackest of shadow
to the high horizons.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sublime majesty of it!&#8221; said the young
woman softly, commenting on the grandeurs.
&#8220;And to think that Lucille won&#8217;t be able to see it
when she comes! It&#8217;s heart-breaking, David!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think&mdash;I hope&mdash;the little sister doesn&#8217;t miss
what she hasn&#8217;t had since she was four years old,&#8221;
he returned, matching her low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know; though it seems as if she must. But
you are making her miss some of the things she
needn&#8217;t miss, David.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been a poor plotter,&#8221; he confessed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit that in getting them out here I was confidently
counting upon breaking it off for Oswald.
But it seems that I have only made matters worse.
The letter that I spoke of was from Herbert. He
has taken a partner in his law business and is giving
himself a vacation. He says Dad&#8217;s health is
still poor and it is hardly right for him to travel
with the care of Lucille; so he, Bert, is coming
along. I suppose I shall be obliged to read the
riot act to him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Virginia was standing on the lowest porch
step and she drew herself up in combative protest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>&#8220;You will do nothing of the sort,&#8221; she declared,
with a touch of her father&#8217;s peremptory manner.
&#8220;If you do, I shall let Lord Cumberleigh and
Freddy Wishart know what a perfectly gorgeous
place this is in which to spend a summer vacation.
Good-night; it&#8217;s late and I&#8217;m going in.&#8221;</p>

<p>When David had descended the hill to his bunk car
headquarters he found that Plegg had not yet
come in. But Jean Marie Fran&ccedil;ois Regnier was
there, dark-faced, and with the Gallic temper
coruscating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thees devil of hard-rock men!&#8221; he sputtered.
&#8220;They &#8217;ave not so moch as the courage of a mice!
They say to me, &#8216;You s&#8217;all timber thees bad place
or shoot it down, or bygod we s&#8217;all strike.&#8217;
<i>Sacr-r-re!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>As once before, in a similar crisis, David Vallory
sat on the edge of his bunk to take off his
lace-boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll think about it, Regnier&#8221; he said slowly.
&#8220;You tell your men that you&#8217;ve put it up to me.
I&#8217;ll see you to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Regnier had gone, David went on mechanically
with his bed-time preparations. Then,
as if at the bidding of a sudden impulse, he hurriedly
put the boots and his coat on again and went
out to the rear platform of the small car.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>When he saw that the lights were still on in Mr.
Grillage&#8217;s Pullman he dropped from the step and
went across the tracks to present himself at the
porter-guarded door of the <i>Athenia</i>.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVIII<br />


In Loco Parentis</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ADMITTED to the office compartment of
the private car, David Vallory found its
occupant preparing to go up to the hotel; but at
the swing of the corridor door Eben Grillage sat
down again in the capacious swing-chair at his
desk and relighted the stub of his cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, David,&#8221; he growled not unkindly;
and before Vallory could speak: &#8220;Vinnie &#8217;phoned
down a few minutes ago to tell me that you&#8217;re
looking for your father to-morrow. That sounds
mighty good to me. We&#8217;ll have another chance
to renew our youth. You don&#8217;t appreciate how
much that means; you&#8217;re too young. But some
day you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>David drew up one of the wicker chairs and sat
down. The abrupt dip into the purely friendly
relations side-tracked his errand, temporarily; but
it also gave him time to gather himself for the
plunge into the weightier matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he assented; &#8220;I had a letter this morning.
There will be three of them; Dad and my
sister and Bert Oswald.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean John Oswald&#8217;s boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is the one. Bert is a lawyer now,
in business for himself in Middleboro.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eben Grillage wagged his head as one incredulous,
and the massive features were relaxed in a
reminiscent smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well; the idea of that little red-headed,
blue-eyed chap of Oswald&#8217;s growing up to be a
man and a lawyer! How time does skip along!&#8221;
Then: &#8220;What&#8217;s he coming out here for? We
don&#8217;t need any lawyers on this job&mdash;not yet, I
hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bert says the trip is a vacation excursion for
him,&#8221; David replied, suppressing Oswald&#8217;s true
motive. Then he began on his own errand. &#8220;I
came over here to bother you for a bit of advice
on something that I&#8217;ve changed my mind about
half a dozen times or more. It&#8217;s that weak place
in the roof of heading Number One that Plegg
wrote you about before I came on the job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At first I was willing to discount all the nervous
stories. I spent one entire summer in hard-rock
work, and I know how prone the drill crews
are to cry &#8216;wolf&#8217; when they drive through something
a little different. But latterly I&#8217;ve been a
little anxious myself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t worry, if I were you,&#8221; said the big
man, with the lenient indulgence of a master for
a neophyte. &#8220;There&#8217;s a good old saying, David,
that you ought always to remember: Never
trouble trouble till trouble troubles you. I&#8217;ve had
a look at that tunnel roof, myself. You needn&#8217;t
lose any sleep over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks a bit bad to me,&#8221; David made bold
to say. &#8220;And now Regnier tells me that the men
have gone from complaining to making threats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Threats?&mdash;what kind of threats?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say if we don&#8217;t timber, or shoot the bad
roof down, they&#8217;ll strike on us; which will be giving
open notice to the railroad people that there
is something wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory did not know that, under conditions
similar to those he was presenting, the king
of the contractors was wont to explode in volcanic
wrath, consigning everybody remotely implicated
to the scrap-heap of the nerveless and the yellow-streaked.
Nor did he know that he was especially
favored when his chief consented to argue the
matter with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has always been that way with the hard-rock
crews,&#8221; the master maintained; &#8220;they&#8217;re
not happy if they don&#8217;t have something to kick
about. As to the threat; Lushing and his inspectors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
know&mdash;or ought to know&mdash;all that anybody
can tell them about that &#8216;fault&#8217;. It&#8217;s their
business to find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>David felt that he was losing ground, but he
tried once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has always seemed better to me to be safe
than sorry,&#8221; he ventured; and he was going on to
make the same suggestion that Plegg had made,
about taking the matter up with the railroad company
for a new contract, when the exponent of
modern business success broke in.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Safety first&#8217; is a good idea, but it has been run
into the ground, like a lot of other good things,
David. You were telling me that your college
vacations were spent working for the railroads,
and there you would naturally get the safety idea
rubbed into you good and hard. I&#8217;ve seen railroad
engineers spend thousands of dollars&mdash;of
other people&#8217;s money&mdash;on precautions that will
never be tested while the world stands. When
you are working for your own pocketbook it&#8217;s
different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet I suppose we ought not to take too many
chances,&#8221; David constrained himself to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is where you are wrong,&#8221; was the prompt
contradiction. &#8220;All business is a taking of
chances. The merchant who buys a stock of goods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
in spring that he hopes to sell in the fall is taking
a chance. The lawyer who expects to charge a
fat fee if he wins his cause is taking a chance.
The farmer who plows and plants is taking a
mighty long chance on what the season and the
weather will do to him. Don&#8217;t you see how it
runs through everything a man can do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take our own job here and look at the hamperings.
I&#8217;m talking to you now as Adam Vallory&#8217;s
boy and not as a hired man. We were
ground to the limit on the bidding; and at every
turn the railroad people are trying to get more
than they bargained for&mdash;something for nothing.
It&#8217;s all right; that&#8217;s their part of it, you&#8217;ll say.
But in addition to all this we&#8217;ve got Jim Lushing
against us; a man who will stoop to any kind of
low, disreputable trickery to do us up. You may
say it&#8217;s dog eat dog, and so it is. But it&#8217;s business.&#8221;</p>

<p>David took a leaf from his father&#8217;s book and
proffered it, not too confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad was always so strong on the ethics of a
thing,&#8221; he began; but Eben Grillage interrupted
with a good-natured laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father is a white-haired old angel; and
he is just about as completely out of touch with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
the modern business world as the other angels
are. There are no theoretical ethics in business,
David. If you don&#8217;t fight for your own hand,
you go to the wall, every time. That is one reason
why I offered you a job. I didn&#8217;t want to
see Adam Vallory&#8217;s boy settle down in the old
Middleboro Security and become a fossilized
back-number before he could grow a beard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here it was, deep in the personalities again,
and David Vallory would have been either more
or less than human if he could have disentangled
himself from the purely friendly relation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been mighty good to me&mdash;good to
all of us,&#8221; he broke out gratefully. &#8220;If I&#8217;ve said
too much about that tunnel roof&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just you forget the tunnel roof and let it go.
It has stood up all right since we drove through
it, and you know what it would cost to shoot it
down and plug the hole. I want to see you succeed,
David, and you can&#8217;t do it if you are always
worrying about the other fellow&#8217;s side of
things. I only wish I had a boy like you of my
own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have something vastly better,&#8221; said the
model son, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vinnie, you mean? Sometimes I think so;
and then, again, I&#8217;m sort of worried. When it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
comes right down to the jumping-off place, I&#8217;m
afraid she isn&#8217;t going to pick out a sure-enough
man. Look at the crowd she runs with! Half
of &#8217;em are after my money, and the other half
haven&#8217;t got brains enough to fry, or sand enough
in &#8217;em to keep the wheels from slipping.&#8221;</p>

<p>David was far enough beyond the tunnel and
all other troubles now to be able to laugh happily.
It was reasonably evident that any obstacles
which might lie in his way in the sentimental
race were not such as might be raised by a purse-proud
father, and once again his heart warmed
toward the benefactor and foster-father who was
so generously overlooking the master-and-man
hamperings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Virginia is your own daughter, Mr. Grillage;
you needn&#8217;t be alarmed about her,&#8221; he put in
loyally.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know; but she&#8217;s got a raft of high-flown notions
about ethical culture&mdash;whatever that is&mdash;and
the brotherhood of man, and &#8216;tainted money&#8217;,
and all that&mdash;you probably know the whole rigmarole.
And when Vinnie sets her head on anything
you couldn&#8217;t switch her with a hundred-and-fifty-ton
crane and a five-yard steam-shovel
put together. I tell her what she needs is to
marry a man who is in the thick of the business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
fight for himself&mdash;and for her. Then she&#8217;d
learn a few practical, every-day facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory felt that it would be almost a
breach of confidence&mdash;the confidence that had
been growing up day by day between Virginia
and himself&mdash;if he should let the talk dig any
deeper into the personalities in Virginia&#8217;s direction.
So he spoke again of his father&#8217;s coming,
and of his hope that the change of scene and
climate might prove beneficial.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make it beneficial,&#8221; declared the big
man, with a return to the genially masterful
mood; and after a few minutes more of the
friendly talk, David took his leave, warming himself
once again at the fires of henchman loyalty.
Who was he to set up the standards of his own
narrow convincements against the wisdom and
experience of a man whose success was equalled
only by his generosity and princely liberality?
And beyond this, had not Eben Grillage as good
as said that his consent was already gained if his
daughter&#8217;s choice should fall upon a man who
was <i>not</i> of the great army of idlers?</p>

<p>Other phases of the talk emphasized themselves
for the young chief of construction after he had
seen the big boss striding sturdily up the steep
path toward the ridge-top hotel. In no uncertain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
sense his father&#8217;s benefactor had shown himself
willing to be a second father to the son, supplying,
from his wider experience of men and
things, the lacks of a too-narrow upbringing. In
an upflash of the newer partisanship, David could
smile at his own compunctions. In a world of
shrewd battlings one might easily theorize too
much. But deep down under this generalization
the new loyalty, born first of worthy gratitude,
was digging a channel for itself; the channel leading
now to blind fealty. The problem was no
longer a question of right and wrong in the abstract.
It was resolving itself into a grim determination
to hew doggedly to the line&mdash;the line
being the success, in a financial sense, of the Grillage
Engineering Company.</p>

<p>With this determination in the saddle, David
Vallory did not return to his bunk car. A locomotive
was about to make the run up to the
tunnel with a supply of freshly blacksmithed drill-bits,
and he boarded it. The night breeze, slipping
down from the peaks of the higher range,
was like a draft of invigorating wine. The moon
had gone down, but the carbide flares and electric
arcs illuminating the scene in the huge cuttings
made the men and machines stand out in harsh
relief. Above the clatter of the locomotive the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
rapid, intermittent volley-fire of the steam-shovels
rose like the snortings of strange monsters; and
against the inky background of the western mountain
a single electric star marked the mouth of
the tunnel.</p>

<p>At the portal David dropped from the step of
the engine and made his way, unaccompanied, into
the heart of the mountain. The thread of incandescent
bulbs starred the blackness, each illuminating
its little circle of the underworld. The
distant clamor of the drills ceased shortly after
David reached the spot where the threatening
roof was sprinkling its daily warnings. Posturing
solely as the cool-headed engineer and technician,
he would have decided at once that the
danger signals were growing more portentous&mdash;did
so decide in the inner depths of him. The
overhead rock had an appearance not unlike that
of a slaking lime bed, checked and crisscrossed in
every direction with fine seams and cracks.</p>

<p>While he was still examining the roof and telling
himself that this was only one of the many
chances that had to be taken in the battle for success,
a man came out of the half-lighted darkness
of the farther depths and spoke to him. It was
Silas Plegg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting your goat so that you can&#8217;t sleep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
nights, is it?&#8221; said the first assistant, with his
teeth-baring smile.</p>

<p>David ignored the reference to his responsibilities
and asked a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any more strike talk among the men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little; yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think about this roof by this
time? I know what you thought a few days
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not up to me to do the thinking. What
do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frankly, Plegg, I don&#8217;t know what to say.
Just before you came up I was thinking that if
I were called in here as an outsider and asked
to give an opinion I&#8217;d say it was a risk&mdash;a damned
bad risk. But as a Grillage man, I&#8217;ve come
around to your point of view on the necessities.
We&#8217;ve got to trust to luck and bully it
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; if the devil doesn&#8217;t take too good care
of his own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that it doesn&#8217;t lie with us any more
to keep this thing quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Have the inspectors caught on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since we haven&#8217;t had a bunch of them jumping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
onto us, I infer not. But there is at least one
warm enemy of yours who knows about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Black Jack Dargin.&#8221;</p>

<p>David flew into a rage for the second time
that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I get a positive order obeyed any more
on this job?&#8221; he rasped. &#8220;How many times have
I got to say that nobody from the outside is to
be allowed in this tunnel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dargin hasn&#8217;t been here,&#8221; said Plegg evenly.
&#8220;But he has had one of his steerers working here
as a mucker.&#8221; A pause, and then, in the same
even tone: &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll have to give up your
idea of running Black Jack off the lot. It isn&#8217;t
worth while, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory was still angry. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be shot if
I&#8217;ll give it up!&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a string
to pull that will clean those Powder Can dives
off the map, and I&#8217;ll pull it to-night before I
sleep!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And take the risk of Dargin&#8217;s giving this
thing away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not considering risks just now! If that
tin-horn gambler thinks he can put something
over on us, let him try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg turned aside and stooped as if to examine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
a joint in the pressure pipe which led the
air from the compressor-plant at the portal to
the drills in the heading. When he straightened
up it was to say, &#8220;Have you seen Lushing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is here at the front again; so Altman told
me this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which means that from now on we&#8217;re to
have him around under foot!&#8221; gritted the angry
one.</p>

<p>Plegg glanced back into the depths where the
<i>chug-chug</i> of the drills had ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better be moving out; they&#8217;re getting
ready to fire a round of shots,&#8221; he offered; and
after they were in the open air and the muffled
reverberations of the dynamite had come rolling
out to jar upon the midnight silence: &#8220;Lushing
will do more than get under foot. He is spiteful,
and when he gets ready to hit out, we&#8217;ll all know
about it. I&#8217;m only hoping that he and Dargin
won&#8217;t get together and compare notes.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had started to walk down to the approach
track where the waiting locomotive was standing
before David made his comment on the Lushing
vindictiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plegg,&#8221; he said grittingly, &#8220;you know, and I
know, the particular reason why Lushing wants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
to stick a knife into us. It&#8217;s running in my mind
that somebody ought to put him out of the game.
And if he strikes me just right, I&#8217;m the man to
do it!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIX<br />


The Ultimatum</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the day succeeding David Vallory&#8217;s midnight
visit to the tunnel the guest list of
the Alta Vista Inn had a number of additions.
Upon the arrival of the stub train from Agorda,
David met the three for whose coming Oswald&#8217;s
letter had prepared him, and even in the moment
of welcomings saw his difficulties take on added
thorninesses. Oswald, his face set in lines of
frowning determination, was evidently anticipating
reproaches, or something sharper; but when
David saw his sister, and marked her quick little
groping for Oswald&#8217;s hands in the descent from
the car-steps, his heart smote him and he said
neither more, nor less, than was meet.</p>

<p>A mountain motor hack was at the service of
the Alta Vista group for the drive to the top of
the ridge, and with the transfer in process, David
had time to observe the other arrivals. One was
a well-groomed young man with sleepy eyes and
a bored expression, and on one of the numerous
traveling-bags obstructing the foot space in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
car David read the initials &#8220;F. W.&#8221; Another of
the newcomers was a rather solemn-faced person
in clothes of English cut; he, also, looked bored,
and the monocle which he occasionally fitted to
an eye with grimaces provocative of subdued
mirth in the other passengers, gave him the appearance
of a weary owl contemplating sad and
depressive surroundings with a single eye. David,
sitting with his father and pointing out the
various phases of the big job as the car climbed
the ridge, needed no additional tags to enable him
to identify the pair on the opposite seat. Of Miss
Virginia&#8217;s retinue at least two, Mr. Frederic
Wishart and the Englishman, Cumberleigh, had
discovered her retreat.</p>

<p>In the hotel dining-room, where he secured a
table for his own party, David ate his heart out
under an outward mask of the welcomer&#8217;s cheerfulness
when he saw Virginia making merry with
the owlish Englishman and the son of the multimillionaire
breakfast-food king at a table four
removes distant. Gone for him were the joyous
excursions over the work in the company of a
khaki-clad maiden whose interest in the technical
activities had been scarcely second to his own.
Gone, likewise, were the ecstatic evenings in the
secluded porch nook, shadowed by the wall-tapping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
fir-tree, with no one to interfere and none
to distract.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we are getting along fairly well,&#8221; David
was saying, continuing the talk with his father
and Oswald and wrenching himself forcibly aside
from the heart-consuming spectacle four tables
away. &#8220;If nothing unforeseen happens, the
through trains ought to be running over the new
line before snow flies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Accidents, you mean?&#8221; queried the sweet-voiced
one who sat in darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Accidents or other hamperings. Of course,
on a job as big as this there is always a chance
for the unexpected.&#8221; And he went on to enumerate
some of the hamperings which might cause
delay, carefully avoiding, however, any mention
of tunnels and caving roofs therein.</p>

<p>Later, the table talk was led to other topics.
David wished to know how they had fared on
the long journey from Middleboro; he spoke of
the satisfaction it gave him to have the family
united again; melting a little in the glow of his
own galvanized warmth, he was even hypocritical
enough to descant upon the good luck which had
enabled Oswald to join the vacation party.</p>

<p>After dinner business intruded. Plegg came
up to secure his chief&#8217;s decision upon certain foundations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
which were being sunk for one of the
bridges, and David had to go with him to the
bunk-car office to consult the blue-prints. When
he was free to return to the Inn he found his
family scattered. Eben Grillage had swooped
down upon the friend of his youth and had spirited
him away; and it was only after some little
search on the porches that David discovered his
sister and Oswald.</p>

<p>Coming up behind them unnoticed, he went
away again without intruding upon them. The
after-glow of another of the gorgeous sunsets
was spreading itself in the western heavens, and
Oswald was describing it for the blind girl. It
was the low-spoken admission of the blind one
that made David forbear to break in. &#8220;You think
I am missing it, Herbert, but that is not so. Sometimes
it seems as if I could see things through your
eyes better than if I had my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>On another of the porches David had a glimpse
of Virginia and the two newcomers, and a dull
fire of resentment was kindled. The daughter of
the luxuries was evidently in her gayest mood,
and if there were any lingering regret for the
change from the technicalities and the duet evenings
in the shadow of the fir-tree her manner did
not betray it. David turned away when he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
her holding a match to light Wishart&#8217;s cigarette.
The most infatuated of lovers may be permitted
a pang of disappointment at the discovery that
he has apparently been useful only as a convenient
fill-in.</p>

<p>Having the social&mdash;and sentimental&mdash;nerve
centers thus painfully cauterized, David was fain
to fall back upon the job and its requirements.
There need be no lack of occupation. He knew
that Plegg would be hard at work checking the
estimate for the month; and there was always the
overseeing round of the night shifts, which one
or the other of them usually made before turning
in. But there was another urge which fitted in
better with the mood of the moment. Plegg&#8217;s
news, that Lushing was back at the head of the
inspection staff, and that Dargin was the possessor
of the tunnel secret, had not yet been acted upon.
In some less morose frame of mind, David Vallory
might have thought twice before yielding to
a sudden impulse to carry the war into the enemy&#8217;s
country. As it was, he turned his back upon
the hotel and a short half-hour later was entering
the single street of the mining-camp.</p>

<p>The impulse which had sent him across the
basin was not very definite in its promptings. In
accordance with the minatory promise made to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Plegg, he had written to the president of the railroad
company, asking that some drastic action be
taken in the matter of the nuisances. Something
might come of this, in time, but meanwhile Dargin
must be prevented from using his weapon.
How to go about the preventing presented a
rather difficult problem. Things which seem
measurably easy of accomplishment at a distance
are apt to take on new and difficult aspects in the
face-to-face encounter, and as David made his
way toward the Dargin lair where he had once
looked on with Plegg, he was still undecided as
to the manner in which the gambler should be
approached.</p>

<p>As he soon found out, an approach of any sort
at the moment was plainly impossible. The bi-monthly
Grillage pay-day was still a fresh memory
and the town and its resorts were filled with the
money-scattering workmen. The Dargin place
was packed to the doors, and David had some
trouble in wedging himself into the gambling room
at the rear of the bar. Here the impossibility of
getting speech with Dargin became apparent. The
master gambler was dealing at the faro table, and
his isolation for the time being was safely assured
and secure.</p>

<p>As David was shouldering his way back to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
street entrance for a breath of clean air a man
in the bar-room throng touched him upon the
shoulder, calling him by name. It was a prompting
of the morose demon in possession that made
him turn and stare at the questioner half-angrily
before he made answer. The man was well-dressed,
something below the middle height, and
rather heavy set, dark, and with a closely cropped
brown beard. The mouth outlined beneath the
tightly curled mustaches was full-lipped and gross,
and the bulging eyes, with a hint of a hard drinker
in them, evenly matched the sensuous lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vallory is my name, yes,&#8221; David admitted,
and the bare admission was a challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine is Lushing,&#8221; was the curt announcement.
&#8220;I suppose you have heard of me before this?&#8221;</p>

<p>David did not say whether he had or had not.
An antagonism of a sort that he had never before
experienced was laying hold upon him so fiercely
that he scarcely dared trust himself to speak. This
was the man who had been audacious enough to
make love to Virginia, and who was now boasting
that he would break the Grillage Engineering
Company.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were looking for me?&#8221; David said.</p>

<p>Lushing bit the end of a cigar and struck a
match.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;ve been wanting to get hold of you,&#8221;
he rapped out, between puffs. &#8220;I want to have
a talk with you. It&#8217;s too noisy here; let&#8217;s go back
to one of Jack&#8217;s private rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>If David Vallory hesitated it was only because
the feeling of antagonism was growing by leaps
and bounds, and he was afraid to be alone with
the man&mdash;afraid for Lushing, not for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it business?&#8221; he inquired curtly. Then he
added: &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting to see Dargin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s business. And if you&#8217;re waiting for
Jack, you&#8217;ll wait a long time. When he sits in
at the game, he stays to see it out. Let&#8217;s get out
of this mess.&#8221;</p>

<p>David reluctantly followed his guide to one of a
series of small card-rooms back of the bar. Lushing
snapped the electric light switch as one who
knew his surroundings intimately, and sat down
at the card-table.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you drink?&#8221; he demanded brusquely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing at all; I&#8217;m not thirsty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lushing pressed the bell-push for himself, and
when the bar-man came, ordered a whiskey-sour.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you change your mind?&#8221; he suggested,
after the drink had been served; and when David
shook his head: &#8220;All right; every man to his own
taste. Here goes,&#8221; and he drained his glass.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>More and more David was wishing himself
well out of it. There could be nothing but enmity
between him and this loose-lipped man across
the card-table, and the savage prompting to precipitate
an open conflict was becoming ungovernable.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll say what you wish to say,&#8221; he grated.
&#8220;My time is pretty strictly limited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if you&#8217;re waiting for Jack Dargin,&#8221; said
Lushing. &#8220;But perhaps you want to get back to
the hotel.&#8221; Then he added in a tone which seemed
to be intentionally insulting: &#8220;They tell me you
are one of Eben Grillage&#8217;s pets.&#8221;</p>

<p>David&#8217;s anger flamed alive like a flash of dry
powder, but he was telling himself in many repetitions
that his time had not yet come.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall get along faster, and perhaps farther,
if you will cut out the personalities,&#8221; he said
sourly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only repeating what I have heard. You
are young to be at the head of a job of this size,
and people have a way of explaining such things
to suit themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might go into the repeating business myself,
if I cared to,&#8221; David was beginning; but Lushing
cut him off with a short laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know; some of them have told you that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
have a personal quarrel with Grillage, and perhaps
some others have hinted that I wanted to
marry into the company and got kicked out for
my impudence. We&#8217;ll let that go. What was, is
ancient history, and we&#8217;re dealing with the here
and now. Your company is as crooked as a dog&#8217;s
hind leg, and if you don&#8217;t know it, you ought to.
Its days on this job are numbered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Threats are the cheapest things in the world,&#8221;
said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find that this is more than a threat.
You are a new man in the field, and I&#8217;ve nothing
against you&mdash;as yet. What I wanted to see you
for was to say to you that you&#8217;d better go while
the sledding is good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are advising me to discharge myself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it&mdash;quit&mdash;throw up the job&mdash;climb out
while you can get out with a whole skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll be shown up with
the other pirates and sneak thieves.&#8221;</p>

<p>David glanced again at the flushed face and
bibulous eyes. It was evident that the drink tossed
off while the bar-man waited was only the latest
of a series which had been begun much earlier
in the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in no condition to talk business with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
me or with any one,&#8221; he said bluntly. &#8220;Some other
time, perhaps, when you are entirely sober&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lushing brought his fist down upon the card-table
with an oath.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, young fellow; you&#8217;ll hear what I&#8217;ve got
to say now, and then you may take it straight to
the fish-eyed old buccaneer you&#8217;re working for.
Grillage hasn&#8217;t a dollar in this world that he has
made honestly, and you may tell him I say so.
Also, you may tell him that I&#8217;m going to make it
my business to hound him to his finish. When all
the crooked deals he has worked off on this job
are shown up, he&#8217;ll be lucky if he can stay out
of the pen. On top of all that, you may tell him
that his daughter will see the day when she&#8217;ll beg
me on her knees to let up&mdash;and I won&#8217;t do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>David was upon his feet and his eyes were
blazing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve said enough, and more than enough!&#8221;
he broke out in hot wrath. &#8220;If you were not too
drunk to be held accountable, I&#8217;d cram your words
down your neck for that insult to Miss Grillage!
Past that, I&#8217;ll say, once for all, that Mr. Grillage
is more than my employer; he is my friend and
my father&#8217;s friend. Go to it when you&#8217;re ready,
and I shall know how to get back at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, Lushing whipped an automatic pistol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
from his pocket and laid it upon the table, covering
it with his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make any bad breaks and I&#8217;ll drill you,&#8221;
he said viciously. &#8220;Take that for a back-sight
any time you feel tempted to beat me up. When
a man of your size comes at me, I shoot first and
shoot quick. I&#8217;m out to get your crooked company
and the man who owns it. You say you&#8217;ll
fight for him, and that puts you on the black list.
I&#8217;m fair enough to give you a tip, and I&#8217;ve given
it to you. If you don&#8217;t get off this job quick and
fade away, you&#8217;ll wake up some fine morning to
find yourself dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>What little calm judgment David Vallory still
retained was telling him to go away; that there
was nothing to be gained by staying and listening
to Lushing&#8217;s threats. But by this time he was
well out of reach of any of the calm voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking it for granted that I&#8217;m unarmed,
and you are right,&#8221; he flashed back. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
care for your gun. You&#8217;ve laid the law down
for me, and now I&#8217;ll lay a little of it down for
you. Your inspectors will be welcome on the job
anywhere and at any time, but as for yourself,
you&#8217;ll stay away from it. If you show up in any
camp of mine, you want to bring that gun along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
with you, for I shall take care to have one of
my own, and I&#8217;ll use it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lushing picked up the weapon and let it lie in
his palm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the little Grillage tell you to kill me off
out of the way?&#8221; he leered.</p>

<p>That was the final straw. David Vallory flung
himself across the card-table in a mad-bull charge,
carrying the table with him in his eagerness to
close with his antagonist. For a few breathless
seconds the battle was obstructed. David&#8217;s rush
had borne Lushing backward, tilting the chair in
which he was sitting until it brought up against
the wall and was crushed under his weight and
David&#8217;s and that of the overturned table. Too
furious to fight coolly, David tried to snatch the
wreck of the broken chair out of the way so that
he could get at the man entangled in it and held
down by the tipped table. One good punch he
got in, or thought he did, and then there was a
stunning crash, a fleeting whiff of powder smoke,
and the light went out.</p>

In the Ore Shed</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN David came to his senses he found
himself lying on bare ground in the dark.
There seemed to be a weight like that of an elephant&#8217;s
knee pressing upon his chest, and it was
with the greatest difficulty that he could get his
breath. Somewhere near at hand he could hear
sounds as of a woman sobbing. Next he realized
vaguely that his boots had been taken off. Groping
aimlessly in the dark, his hand found the
woman. She was kneeling beside him, and at his
touch the sobs became a choking cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Davie, dear; is it yourself that&#8217;s alive?&#8221; The
voice seemed to come from an immense distance,
but he heard it and recognized it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, Judith?&#8221;&mdash;then, jerkily: &#8220;What&#8217;s&mdash;happened&mdash;to
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis killed dead you are!&#8221; she whimpered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing like it.&#8221; The words were coming a
bit easier now and he did not have to stop and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
gasp between each pair of them. Also, he was
beginning to remember some of the events precedent.
&#8220;Did&mdash;did the house fall down on me?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim Lushing&mdash;the black curse be upon him!&mdash;he
shot you; didn&#8217;t you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember. Whereabouts am I hit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be knowing that at all, Davie; I&#8217;m
just this minute here. The shed watchman came
and told me that Lushing had killed you in Jack&#8217;s
place down the street. &#8217;Twas scared they were
to have you found dead in that place, so they
carried you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scared?&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;For what your men might do; there&#8217;s a many
of them in town, and they&#8217;d have wrecked the
place. Where is it hurting you, Davie, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel as if somebody had given me the heart
punch&mdash;I believe that&#8217;s what the ring-fighters call
it. But it&#8217;s letting up a bit now. Where am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Murtrie ore shed. They&#8217;d be putting
it up to Mike Drogheen, the watchman, to say
he&#8217;d shot you&mdash;taking you for an ore thief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And paying him well for it, I suppose.&#8221; He
was groping carefully for the wound and found
only a rip in the left breast of the brown duck
shooting-coat. There was no blood; only a tremendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
soreness. He raised himself and sat up.
&#8220;If we only had a light of some sort,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; she said, and ran away to come back
within the minute with the watchman&#8217;s lantern.
&#8220;Poor old Mike&#8217;s hiding beyond in the blacksmith
shop, scared trembling at the lie he&#8217;s thinking
he&#8217;s got to tell. Don&#8217;t sit up, Davie; you
might be bleeding to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>David was groping again, and this time, out
of the ripped pocket of the brown coat he fished
an engineer&#8217;s field-note book. Then he knew why
there was no blood, and why the body area behind
the pocket was as painful as if it had been beaten
with a hammer. Lushing&#8217;s shot had been a glancing
one, and the thick note-book had turned it
aside. There was little left of the book save
the perforated leather cover and a mass of torn
leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fellows who carried me off must have
been pretty badly rattled, not to have found out
that I wasn&#8217;t even scratched,&#8221; he commented.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis no wonder. When Mike brought me
here, the doctor himself would have said you were
dead. There was no breath in you at all, and
your heart had stopped entirely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What became of Lushing?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Tis little I know, or care&mdash;the black dog!
Mike says they told him you&#8217;d half killed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I meant to,&#8221; said David soberly.
&#8220;And after this, I suppose I&#8217;ll have to kill him&mdash;or
let him kill me. But that&#8217;s a future. He
knows what he&#8217;s got to do if he wants to keep
on living. Where are my boots?&#8221;</p>

<p>She found the boots with the help of the lantern
and gave them to him. He put them on,
though the effort, and the lacing of them, made
him grit his teeth and swear.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they want to take my boots off for?&#8221;
he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;&#8217;Tis that way
in the camps. They wouldn&#8217;t be letting anybody
die with his boots on, if they could help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rotten superstition!&#8221; he complained, and
swore again.</p>

<p>The woman heard wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis you that have changed, Davie, till I&#8217;d
hardly be knowing you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;ve changed. And so have you, Judith.
Are you living with Dargin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But from what they tell me, you might as
well be. You&#8217;ve taken help from him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>&#8220;And if I have; &#8217;tis nothing I&#8217;ve taken that an
honest woman might not take.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re telling me the truth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am. When did I ever lie to you, Davie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; he conceded. But the main question
was yet untouched. &#8220;I know how you came here
to Powder Can&mdash;Plegg told me,&#8221; he went on
bluntly. &#8220;It&#8217;s no place for you, here in Powder
Can. You know that, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where would I be going, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>David held his head in his hands and tried to
think. With the return of his faculties the spirit
of morose disheartenment and impatient resentment
which had brought him to the mining-camp,
and had been the chief factor in precipitating
the quarrel with Lushing, was reasserting itself.
Since the bitter moods grow by what they feed
upon, he could see nothing in just perspective.
What a fool&#8217;s Paradise he had been living in
since the Grillage private car had come to anchor
in the construction yard! He had been crying for
the moon, and the moon had been kind enough to
shine for him&mdash;when there was no one else to
shine upon. But now there were others....</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said abstractedly, in answer
to her question as to where she should go. &#8220;It&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
a pretty tough old world, Judith.&#8221; Then, suddenly:
&#8220;Are you still blaming me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what would I be blaming you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For chasing around with you in the old days
and giving you the idea that I was going to marry
you some time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all past and gone, Davie, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Past and gone, maybe, but that doesn&#8217;t let
me out. I know you&#8217;ve got your father, but I
can&#8217;t help feeling more or less responsible for
you. It has worried me a lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t be worrying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it. Last year, after I went to
Wisconsin, I had a sort of plan worked out, and
I wrote you twice before I found out that you&#8217;d
left Middleboro. What you need&mdash;what you&#8217;ve
always needed, Judith&mdash;is something that you
could put your whole heart into, like&mdash;well, like
music. My notion was that you could go to some
good conservatory and study, and I was ready
to help you. Is it too late to consider something
of that kind now?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;&#8217;Tis much too late,
Davie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that you&#8217;re tied up with this man
Dargin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll leave Jack Dargin be. There&#8217;s the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
father; he&#8217;s not what he used to be, Davie; what
with mother dying, and me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he interposed hastily. &#8220;Plegg told
me about that, too. But here&#8217;s more trouble,
Judith. This man Dargin is your friend, or at
least I&#8217;m trying to believe that he has befriended
you, and I&#8217;ve got to chase him and his bunch out
of Powder Can. I came over here to-night to tell
him so. That muddles things still worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better be letting Powder Can alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t do that; it&#8217;s cutting too much out
of the efficiency record on the job. I can&#8217;t fight
Lushing and his outfit, and a booze joint as well.
And right there, you break in. From what you&#8217;ve
admitted, a lick at Jack Dargin is going to hurt
you worse than it will him. And I don&#8217;t want to
hurt you, Judith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t be thinking so much about
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I should; you need somebody to think
about you. I wish you&#8217;d consider that notion of
mine. You could take your father with you. He
is too good a workman to be throwing himself
away in a mine repair shop. He can get a better
job anywhere he goes. I could get Mr. Grillage
to help a bit in that direction. He knows everybody,
everywhere.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>&#8220;He&#8217;d be wanting to know why,&#8221; she objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if he does? I&#8217;ll tell him why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him that you&#8217;re trying to help a poor
girl back to her feet?&mdash;and you wanting to marry
his daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you I wanted to marry his daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s little goes on in the camps that we
don&#8217;t hear in Powder Can. There&#8217;s never a man
of yours to come over here without having his
say about you and the daughter of the man you&#8217;d
be working for. &#8217;Tis well I know it was Vinnie
Grillage you were telling me about that night at
home when you were leaving. I&#8217;d not be messing
up your life and hers, Davie.&#8221;</p>

<p>He forced a sour smile. &#8220;My part of it is
already messed up. Vinnie has been good to me&mdash;chiefly
because we were kiddies together, long
before I knew you, Judith. But that&#8217;s all there
is to it. There are two other entries now, and
I&#8217;m out of the race. Does that make it any easier
for you to think of my plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not!&#8221; she flashed out, almost vindictively,
he thought.</p>

<p>Since there seemed to be nothing more to be
said, he got upon his feet, scarcely realizing that
the girl stooped and put her arms around him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
half lifted him. For a few seconds the dimly
lighted interior of the ore shed spun around in
dizzying circles, and the bullet bruise throbbed
like a whirlwind of hammer blows. But he found
he could breathe better standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get back to camp,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Have
you any idea what time it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis early yet.&#8221; Then, anxiously: &#8220;You
couldn&#8217;t be walking all that way, Davie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can; I&#8217;ll be all right in a few minutes
more. Can you show me the way out of this
place? I don&#8217;t want to go through the town
unless I have to.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not show him; she led him, with a
strong arm under his to steady him. At the
wagon gate at the rear of the ore yard he would
have sent her home, but she would not go. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
not fit you are to be going alone,&#8221; she said; and
in spite of his urgings she went on with him,
choosing a path that skirted the shoulder of the
hill and left the town to the right. In sober silence
they walked on until half of the distance
between Powder Can and the construction camp
lay behind them. Then David Vallory made his
urgings mandatory.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go back,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;I&#8217;m quite all
right, now. If Dargin should hear of this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>&#8220;What is it Jack Dargin can do to you?&#8221; she
interrupted shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is something about the work; something
that he knows. If he should tell Lushing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She interrupted again. &#8220;What has Jack got
against you that would make him be giving you
away to Jim Lushing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you a little while ago. I&#8217;m trying to
wipe him and his man-traps off the map, and he
doubtless knows it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack Dargin would only be respecting you the
more for that. Sure, it&#8217;s himself that knows how
bad Powder Camp would be needing a cleaning
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, good heavens, girl! Dargin is the head
and front of the lawlessness himself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis so; but that makes no difference. You
can&#8217;t tell what&#8217;s in the heart of a man, Davie&mdash;and
I know Jack Dargin; that side of him that
not you, nor any one else knows. He&#8217;d fight you;
maybe he&#8217;d kill you. But he&#8217;d respect you the
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a grim humor in the paradox, but
David Vallory was not in the mood to appreciate
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be gunning for me; and so will Lushing.
But I don&#8217;t care; I&#8217;ll fight the whole outfit, if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
have to. I was fool enough to go into that dive
to-night unarmed, but that won&#8217;t happen again.
Lushing had pulled a gun on me; that was one
reason why I jumped him. The next time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis little you&#8217;d know about the shooting,
Davie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I don&#8217;t know I can learn. Now you
are going straight back home from here ... no,
not another step with me. Good-night&mdash;Glory&mdash;and&mdash;God
bless you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once again, if David Vallory could have had
a small modicum of the gift of omniscience; could
have detached his astral body, let us say, to send
it back over the road he had just traversed; there
would have been revelations, puzzling, perhaps,
but still not without interest to one fighting
against the powers of darkness. At the side of
the road the detached messenger would have
found a woman, crumpled in a forlorn heap on
the cold ground, and sobbing as if her heart would
break. Still farther back, in the mining-camp itself,
the astral David might have looked into a
shabbily luxurious upper room where a curious
confirmation of Judith Fallon&#8217;s prediction touching
the contradictory motives which may lie side
by side in the human heart was staging itself.</p>

<p>After the fight in the card-room and its supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
tragical outcome, the down-stairs game-room
had been hastily closed. As on the night of
Plegg&#8217;s eavesdropping, the upper room held two
occupants, and they were the same two whose
voices had reached the first assistant through the
partly opened gallery window. And, as before,
the lop-shouldered man was the bearer of news.</p>

<p>&#8220;By cripes! I guess I know what I&#8217;m talking
about?&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just come from there.
He&#8217;s gone, I tell you; lit out&mdash;skipped. The
watchman swears he don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; about it&mdash;didn&#8217;t
go near the shed after they took him
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The master gambler, again with his hands in
his pockets, and again tilting gently in the wooden-seated
chair, nodded his approval. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad of
it,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The hell you are! And him tryin&#8217; to butt in
on your game and run you out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said&#8221;&mdash;curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to use that dope that you
pulled out o&#8217; me at the end of a gun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in a thousand years, Simmy. Haven&#8217;t
you been with me long enough to know that I&#8217;m
no damn&#8217; worm to crawl up a man&#8217;s leg and bite
him to death? You say the young duck&#8217;s alive
and has made his get-away. That&#8217;s all right. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
he comes at me like a two-fisted man, maybe I&#8217;ll
send him word that he&#8217;d better come heeled. But
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t take the dope and do him up the
way I was tellin&#8217; you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, by cripes! I know somebody that
will take it&mdash;and pay good money for it!&#8221; shrilled
the disappointed one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grillage, you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I tried him, and what do I get? He tells
that big, black nigger porter of his to put me out
of the car. I&#8217;ll show him&mdash;him and Vallory at
the same clatter!&#8221;</p>

<p>The master gambler got up, as if to signify
that he had heard enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better look out that you don&#8217;t get stepped on&mdash;like
other worms&mdash;Simmy,&#8221; he warned; and
then, reaching for the hanging lamp over the table
to turn it out: &#8220;Get a crawl on you; I&#8217;m going to
shut up shop.&#8221;</p>

The Other David</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN David Vallory, plodding doggedly,
reached the construction camp upon his
return from Powder Can, he found Herbert Oswald
waiting for him at the steps of the office
bunk car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody had gone to bed in the hotel, and
I thought I&#8217;d straggle down to see if I could find
your headquarters,&#8221; was the way in which the
young lawyer accounted for himself. &#8220;If you
are tired and want to turn in, you are at liberty
to shoo me away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said David crisply. &#8220;Come on in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oswald groped his way into the dark interior
of the car at the heels of his crusty welcomer and
found a seat on Plegg&#8217;s unoccupied bunk while
David was lighting a lamp. At the blowing-out
of the match, the lamp-lighter stood staring
gloomily down upon his late-in-the-evening visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know pretty well what you&#8217;ve come to say,&#8221;
he thrust in gruffly. &#8220;Suppose you say it and have
it over with.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>Oswald looked up in mild surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t come here to scrap with you, David.
And, so far as I know, I haven&#8217;t done anything
to make you run at me with a chip on your shoulder.
Of course, I know you are thinking I ought
not to have come out here, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I may think doesn&#8217;t seem to cut any
figure,&#8221; said David, with the air of a man who
would rather precipitate a quarrel than avoid one.
&#8220;I told you exactly and precisely what I thought
a year ago as I was leaving Middleboro, and I
haven&#8217;t had any reason to change my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oswald, ready enough in any legal matching of
man against man, seemed helplessly nonplussed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have changed rather ferociously,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know how to take you.
If you are giving me a fair shot at your present
self, you are not the David Vallory I used to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am not the same. A little while ago I
was trying my best to kill a man; I shall do it
yet, one of these days, if he doesn&#8217;t keep out of
my sight. But go on and say what you&#8217;ve got
to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It amounts to this: for a whole year I&#8217;ve kept
faith with you&mdash;honest faith&mdash;and every day of
that year has been a day of heartburnings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
regrets. Your attitude toward your sister is entirely
unreasonable. There have been blind wives
before this, and they have been happy wives&mdash;and
mothers, for that matter; at least, their blindness
hasn&#8217;t necessarily been a bar to happiness.
A year ago, if I had spoken, I should have spoken
only for myself: now I am speaking for Lucille
as well as for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All of which is entirely beside the question,&#8221;
was the irritable rejoinder. &#8220;I know Lucille, and
however far she has allowed herself to go in the
matter of learning to care for you or for any
man, it&#8217;s a sure thing she has never thought of
marriage, even as a possibility. If you propose
it, two things will happen; she will wake up to
the fact that she has been mistaking love for
friendship; and she will realize that she has to
refuse the love. After that, her life will be nothing
but a miserable, repining blank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t agree with you at all,&#8221; objected the
lover, argumentatively ready to defend his own
point of view. &#8220;If you were the David Vallory
I once knew, you would listen to reason; at least,
to the extent of giving your sister a voice in ordering
her own future. I have come to the fork
of the road, David, and I am here to say it to
you, face to face. I need Lucille, and she needs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
me. When the time is fully ripe I shall ask her
to be my wife. You put me under bonds of a
certain sort a year ago, but now I shall refuse
longer to be bound by them; I repudiate them
absolutely.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory sat down, and for a time the
silence of the small car interior was broken only
by the clash and jangle of a shifting-engine in the
upper yard. Finally the decision came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oswald, Lucille is my sister, and I am going
to stand between her and the life of heartbroken
wretchedness you are planning for her. You give
me your word that you will not break over while
you are both here together, and upon that condition
you may stay in Powder Gap as long as you
see fit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oswald stood up and his lips were pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I refuse to submit to any such unreasonable
and humiliating condition&mdash;what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory frowned up at his one-time
schoolmate.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that you have been bound by your
promise of a year ago, but that you now repudiate
it; as a man of honor, you are bound by it
until I release you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not answering my question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer it. The stub train going east leaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
here every morning at seven-thirty; I&#8217;ll give you
a day or two in which to think it over&mdash;with the
promise still holding good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if, at the end of the day or two, I still
refuse to recognize your right to interfere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not Middleboro; and, as you have remarked,
I am not the David Vallory you used to
know. If you still decline to listen to reason,
you&#8217;ll take that train and get out of here&mdash;if I
have to hog-tie you and throw you into the baggage-car!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>David!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t beg; I mean it. I am neither
drunk nor insane. You have said your say and I
have said mine, and that settles it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young lawyer took a step toward the door.
But with his hand on the knob he stopped and
faced about.</p>

<p>&#8220;So this is what Eben Grillage has done for
you, is it?&#8221; he grated. &#8220;Like master, like man;
with the doctrine of brute force for your code.
I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it possible for the son
of your father, David.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had the brute force all along, only I
haven&#8217;t had sense enough to apply it,&#8221; was the
surly rejoinder. &#8220;But it&#8217;s never too late to mend.
Good-night&mdash;if you&#8217;re going.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>&#8220;I am going, but not before I have finished
saying my say. For the present, and purely because
I don&#8217;t consider the time fully ripe, I shall
postpone asking your sister to marry me. But
I refuse utterly and definitely to be bound by your
tyrannical conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shortly after Oswald had gone, David Vallory
rummaged in Plegg&#8217;s kit-locker until he found a
blued service revolver in its holster. He hung it
under his coat by the shoulder-strap, and then dug
further for a supply of cartridges. Thus armed,
he took to the open again. The shock of the
bullet bruise was still unsteadying him, and the
bruise itself was hurting savagely, but he would
not give up to it. At Brady&#8217;s Cut he found
Plegg.</p>

<p>&#8220;The war is on,&#8221; he announced briefly, when
he had taken the first assistant aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have seen Lushing?&#8221; Plegg asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and he gave himself away: says he
means to break us. We had it back and forth for
a few minutes, and then he pulled a gun on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; said Plegg. &#8220;Where were you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In one of Dargin&#8217;s card-rooms. We mixed
it. I couldn&#8217;t stand for the gun-pulling&mdash;and
some other things. He tried to plug me, but I&#8217;m
hoping he got as good as he sent. Anyhow, I&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
cleared the air a bit. I&#8217;ve taken the liberty of
borrowing your extra forty-five, and I&#8217;m going
loaded for him after this. I&#8217;ve told him what he
may expect if he shows his face on this job again
while I&#8217;m here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake! I&mdash;well, it isn&#8217;t my put
in, but you&#8217;ve rather got me going, you know.
Can you&mdash;er&mdash;do you know how to use the forty-five?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very well; I did a little pistol-practice in
Florida. But to-morrow you&#8217;ll take me back in
the hills and show me a bit. Just now we&#8217;ve got
other fish to fry. We&#8217;re going to fight Lushing
on his own ground. He says we&#8217;re a gang of
thieves, and if we have the name, we may as well
have the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But even if you&#8217;ve bluffed him into staying off
the job, he still has the ear of the railroad people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right; I&#8217;ll fight him to a knockout,
all the way up to Mr. Ford&mdash;if he wants to carry
it that far. In the meantime we&#8217;ll show him, and
the men who are paying his salary, that we know
how to hit back when they call us thieves. Pass
the word to our staff, and let the fellows pass it
on to the foremen and subcontractors. They&#8217;ll
know how to cut the corners, and how to keep
the railroad inspectors from finding out&mdash;no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
coarse-hand work, you know, Plegg, but every
dollar that can be squeezed out of this job from
now on. That&#8217;s what we want.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg was shaking his head like a man in a
maze; and the new chief&mdash;new now in his attitude
as well as in the shortness of his service&mdash;went
on.</p>

<p>&#8220;About that weak spot in the tunnel; have you
found out who gave it away to Dargin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; a fellow named Backus, who worked in
one of the muck shifts. The men say he was a
steerer for Dargin&#8217;s faro-game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has become of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s fired: I suppose he&#8217;s in Powder Can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the man we want. I&#8217;m going to put it
up to you, Plegg, to find him and grab him before
he gets next to Lushing. When he is found,
buy him, and shoot him out of the country&mdash;anywhere
where he&#8217;ll be out of Lushing&#8217;s reach until
we get this job done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if he can&#8217;t be bought?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lock him up somewhere and keep him from
talking. Now about the bad roof itself: that is
where Lushing can hit us the hardest. Give Regnier
his tip, and do it to-night. Tell him to have
the tunnel re-wired for lights so there won&#8217;t be a
bulb anywhere near that soft spot. Tell him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
keep his men quiet if he has to raise the pay of
every man in the three shifts. Then make him
understand that the rule against the admission of
outsiders must be rigidly enforced, if he has to
maintain an armed guard at the portal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t keep Lushing&#8217;s inspectors out,&#8221;
Plegg suggested mildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming to that. Regnier must see to it
that some man of ours who can be trusted is
within reach every time an inspector goes in. We
don&#8217;t care to hurt anybody needlessly, but if one
of our hard-rock bullies should happen to get
into a scrap with the man who chances to discover
that &#8216;fault&#8217;&mdash;well, you know what I mean. Mr.
Grillage says that place is perfectly safe, and
we&#8217;re going to take his word for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first assistant nodded, and the slow smile
bared his teeth and wrinkled at the corners of
his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly owe you an apology,&#8221; he said, with
the faintest suggestion of irony in his tone; &#8220;several
of them, in fact. There was a time when I
fancied you were going to be too good&mdash;to revert
to that morning in the Pullman a year ago; and
I imagine Mr. Grillage harbored the same inadequate
notion. You&#8217;ll want to be getting back to
headquarters, I suppose: there is an engine due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
down from the tunnel&mdash;there it comes&mdash;I&#8217;ll flag
it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>David caught the eastbound engine, but he did
not stop off at the headquarters camp. That was
because Crawford, the concrete bridge builder,
was at the yard platform to climb to the cab with
a bit of news. Under new orders, inspectors had
been placed at the three bridges in Crawford&#8217;s
section, and they were in relays so that there was
hardly an hour in the three shifts when one of
them was not on duty. Crawford was looking
for Plegg, but when he found that the first assistant
was unattainable, he unburdened himself to
the chief, setting forth the hard conditions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said David, while the engine halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;er&mdash;making it sort of difficult for me,&#8221;
said Crawford, unwilling to go much deeper into
the matter in the face of Plegg&#8217;s inhibition forbidding
detail talk with the boss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Difficult? How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;there can&#8217;t very well be two bosses
on a job, and when I give an order and Strayer
countermands it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say that Strayer is trying to
boss your job?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It amounts to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>David turned to the engine-driver.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>&#8220;Run us down to bridge Number Two, Pete,&#8221;
he ordered, and the heavy construction locomotive
lumbered down through the yard and out
over the switches.</p>

<p>The run was a short one, and at the bridge
approach David and his assistant got off to walk
over to the new structure. The bridge plant was
well lighted by carbide gas flares, and prominent
on the form stagings was the big figure of Strayer,
the railroad inspector. David Vallory called up
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down here a minute, Strayer; I want to
talk to you,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>When the railroad engineer joined him he led
the way to the cement platform, where the noise
of the mixer was less insistent.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the idea, Strayer?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>The big man did not affect to misunderstand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know perfectly well, Vallory; or if you
don&#8217;t, you ought to. Crawford&#8217;s scamping these
bridges shamelessly. He is scanting the &#8216;mix&#8217;,
and also the reinforcing steel. I&#8217;ve caught him
at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you complain to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil good would it do? I&#8217;ve yelled
at you people for everything, and you patch one
hole only to leave another.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>&#8220;I suppose you have your orders to come here
and take the direction of the work out of the
hands of my man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have orders to see that you don&#8217;t pull any
more bones on us, if I have to eat and sleep on
the job to prevent it. And I&#8217;m like little old
Casabianca, Vallory; I obey orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who gave you the orders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lushing: he&#8217;s back now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that he&#8217;s a damned crook,
himself, Strayer?&#8221;</p>

<p>The square-jawed, bearded inspector laughed
grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Set a thief to catch a thief, eh?&#8221; he grinned.
&#8220;Between us two, Vallory, I haven&#8217;t much use for
Lushing; none at all, personally. But he&#8217;s the
boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know where he is now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he&#8217;s over at Powder Can: makes his
headquarters in the Hophra House.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I take it you&#8217;re not particularly struck on
standing over Crawford this way, day and night,
are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you put it that way, I&#8217;m not. Crawford&#8217;s
a good boy, and he means well. See here,
Vallory, if you&#8217;ll give me your word that you&#8217;ll
make the boy live up to the specifications on these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
bridges, I&#8217;ll do what I can to keep Lushing off
of you. Is it a go?&#8221;</p>

<p>David was thoughtful for a moment, and then
he said: &#8220;I&#8217;ll do better than that, Strayer. I&#8217;m
needing another engineer to handle the tunnel approach
work on the other side of the mountain.
I know what the railroad company is paying you,
and I&#8217;ll better the salary. This is straight goods.
What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>The big man shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t to make a break like that at
me, Vallory, and you know it. It&#8217;s too bald, and&mdash;well,
dog-gone it all, I thought better of you!&#8221;
The inspector turned and walked away with his
head down and his hands in his pockets. David
Vallory waited until he had passed the corner of
the cement house, and then, at a signal from Crawford,
he sprang upon the bridge stagings.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re up against it,&#8221; said the bridge builder
hastily; &#8220;that&#8217;s why I went after Plegg. We&#8217;ve
reached the point where we&#8217;ve got to place the
top span reinforcement, <i>and I haven&#8217;t got the
steel</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way,&#8221; Crawford explained, still more
hurriedly. &#8220;When we begun on this job, Plegg
and I figured the plans over and he&mdash;that is, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
concluded that it was simply wasting steel to put
it in as thickly as the plans called for&mdash;why, the
factor of safety was the whole cheese! So we
agreed to cut the steel down. If you can&#8217;t get
Strayer away from here for an hour or so, I&#8217;ll
have to stop the run and take the risk of the concrete&#8217;s
setting in the forms while we&#8217;re getting
some more steel down here.&#8221;</p>

<p>A month earlier David Vallory would have
known what to say, and would have said it, without
garnishings. But now he merely nodded and
walked down the runway and across to the cement
house where Strayer was still pacing back
and forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;This situation needs threshing out from the
bottom up, Strayer,&#8221; he began crisply. &#8220;Suppose
you get on the engine and go up to headquarters
with me where we can fight it out to some sort
of a conclusion. I&#8217;m tired of this business of
scrapping with you fellows all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Vallory, but Lushing is the man
you&#8217;ll have to talk to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re his second, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but you know the rules; I don&#8217;t have
anything to say when he is on the job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he isn&#8217;t on the job. He had a racket
with a man over in Powder Can a couple of hours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
ago, and they tell me he&#8217;s knocked out for the
present. That puts it up to you, again, doesn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes; I guess so&mdash;if he&#8217;s&mdash;how badly is
he hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; pulled a gun on a man, and
the man jumped him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strayer shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bad; neither Mr. Ford nor Mr. Maxwell
will stand for anything like that. Just between
us two, Vallory, Lushing has always spent
a lot of time in Powder Can&mdash;did it while he was
with your people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. But now that he&#8217;s out of it, temporarily,
at least, why can&#8217;t we get together and
straighten up some of the kinks? You know how
exasperating it is for these fellows of mine to
have somebody standing over them with a club
all the time. Come on up to camp with me and
we&#8217;ll hammer it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crawford had stopped his concrete mixer because
he had to; no more concrete could be poured
until the steel bars were placed. The crisis had
come, and while Strayer hesitated, David Vallory,
the new David, took the deep-water plunge into
the stagnant pool of open trickery. Crawford&#8217;s
men were bringing the scanted supply of steel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
bars, getting in each other&#8217;s way to kill time.
David stepped over to the steel pile and counted
the pieces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Crawford!&#8221; he called out; &#8220;you haven&#8217;t
got enough steel here! Heavens and earth, man!
don&#8217;t you know any better than to run right up
against a shortage like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Crawford gasped twice, and then he understood.
&#8220;Ding bust it, Mr. Vallory, I ought to
be fired! Mr. Strayer, here, has been keeping
me so busy that I haven&#8217;t looked at that steel
pile. What are we going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do? You&#8217;ll just have to place what you&#8217;ve
got, and hold your mixer until we can get some
more down to you. I&#8217;ll go back to the yard and
see that it&#8217;s hustled out. Come on, Strayer; let&#8217;s
take a ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crisis was past and the big inspector
climbed on the engine with the Grillage chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take an hour off with you, Vallory, after
I&#8217;ve seen that steel put on the car,&#8221; he laughed;
and at a sign from David, the throttle was opened
and the locomotive clattered away up the grade.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXII<br />


At Bridge Three</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER the dash in the card-room at Black
Jack Dargin&#8217;s place, and its immediate and
transforming consequences, Silas Plegg, shrewd
observer and most efficient of assistants, looked
confidently for trouble, and went about prepared
to stand by his chief when the trouble should
materialize. It was during Lushing&#8217;s administration
as the Grillage chief of construction that the
Powder Can kennels had begun to flourish, and
it had been broadly hinted that he had been a
sharer in the profits. Rumor had it that he was
still hand-in-glove with the kennel-keepers; and
with such a lawless contingent at his command,
the ex-chief became&mdash;at least in Plegg&#8217;s estimation&mdash;a
man whose enmity was to be feared.</p>

<p>Besides keeping a brotherly watch over his
chief, Plegg contrived to keep in touch with the
Powder Can end of things. Lushing, he learned,
had been laid up for a matter of two or three
days as the result of the brief card-room battle,
and he was still making his headquarters in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
Powder Can tavern. Thus far he had not been
visible on the work, though from the increased
activities of his inspectors it was apparent that
he was directing a searching campaign of investigation.</p>

<p>Vallory&#8217;s men were required to dig try-holes
beside foundation walls of abutments and retaining
masonry to prove that the foundations went
deep enough. Test-borings were made in the
fills to ascertain their density. The slopes of the
hill cuttings were surveyed and re-surveyed to
make sure that the angles agreed with the map
notes. In one of the bridges, Strayer&mdash;this time
with apologies to David Vallory&mdash;had holes
drilled to verify the placing of the reinforcing
steel. In uncounted ways the investigation was
pushed; to the discomfort of all concerned&mdash;and
also to the sharpening of the wits of those who
had something to conceal.</p>

<p>Throughout this interval David Vallory gave
an excellent imitation of a man hard at work,
riding the line incessantly, encouraging, driving;
plotting with his subordinates to outwit the inspectors,
and keeping a vengeful eye out for
Lushing. In due time it began to be whispered
about that &#8220;the little big boss,&#8221; as he was affectionately
called by the rank and file, not only &#8220;had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
it in&#8221; for Lushing, but that he had fairly bluffed
the chief inspector off the job. It was known that
he went armed; and on at least one occasion when
he disappeared for an hour or so in Little Creek
gorge, there was some one to report that he had
spent the time practicing at a target with a
&#8220;forty-five.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naturally, with so many working crises thickly
bestudding the days, David had little time to
climb the hill to the Inn; or, if he had the time,
he seldom took it. Duty visits he paid, indeed,
to his father and sister in the tree-sheltered cottage;
but these were brief&mdash;crabbedly brief when
Oswald chanced to be one of the cottage&#8217;s inmates.
On all of these excursions he avoided the
hotel, with morose offishness in the saddle. None
the less, he now and then got a glimpse of Virginia&mdash;and
chanced to see her always in company
with one or both of the men upon whom the desirable
moon&mdash;unattainable by those who cry for
it&mdash;seemed now to be shining its brightest.</p>

<p>It was after one of these brief evening visits
to the cottage under the pines that David found
Plegg waiting for him at the foot of the ridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just to make sure you shouldn&#8217;t be taken off
your guard,&#8221; said the first assistant; and without
further preface: &#8220;Lushing is on his way up here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
with a bunch of men sworn in as deputies. Crawford
has just &#8217;phoned in from bridge Number
One.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the object?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody seems to know, but I have a guess
coming. Burford, the new transit-man working
with Strayer, gave me a hint. He&#8217;s a soak, and
yesterday, after he&#8217;d been hitting his pocket-bottle
pretty freely, he let out a word or two about
something sensational which was to follow this
epidemic of inspection we&#8217;ve been having.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t describe it, did he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he was so plainly &#8216;lit up&#8217; that I didn&#8217;t
pay much attention to him. But since, I&#8217;ve been
piecing the odd bits together. This dead set that
the railroad force has been making at us can
have only one object&mdash;to get evidence of some
sort against us that will hold in court.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if they have the evidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The tunnel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; that is safe, as yet, I believe. It is in
the bridges. There is a certain specified penalty
for jerry-building bridges that are to be used for
human traffic, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bosh!&#8221; said David. &#8220;These little two-by-four
spans we are throwing over the Powder River<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
would carry anything you could pile upon them;
you know they would, Plegg. And they&#8217;d do it
if they didn&#8217;t have a single bar of steel in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said Plegg, with a dry smile. &#8220;But
we&#8217;d better be getting over to the car and the
&#8217;phone. If those temporary sheriffs are coming
up here, we ought to know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lushing won&#8217;t come,&#8221; David averred, as they
walked together toward the bunk car office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d better not.&#8221;</p>

<p>The service telephone was buzzing when they
entered the car. Plegg picked up the receiver and
held it to his ear. After a time, he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s
Crawford again. He is at Number Three bridge
now. The Lushing crowd had a break-down with
their gasoline push-car, and Tommy skipped
across the hill in the hair-pin curve and got to
Number Three ahead of them. He says he
talked to one of the men who came back to Number
One to borrow a monkey-wrench. The man
was foolish enough to let the cat out of the bag
and brag about it. The bunch is coming up here
to arrest you and Mr. Grillage. Crawford wants
to know what he shall do with the few minutes
he has at his disposal.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory took three seconds for reflection.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>&#8220;Tell him he has a brain of his own, and now
is a good time to use it,&#8221; he said shortly. &#8220;And
you may add that we&#8217;d like to buy a little delay
if there is any in the market.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg repeated the message, rounding it out
with a demand for a quick report as to results.
The waiting interval was remarkably short.
When the &#8217;phone buzzed again, Plegg answered
with a single word. &#8220;Shoot!&#8221; he said, and David,
sitting in the opposite bunk, could hear the
minified repetition of the reporting voice without
being able to distinguish the words. Crawford
was brief, as befitted a man of action; and when
Plegg returned the receiver to its hook he was
smiling grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to hand it to Tommy for being
able to make a hurry use of what little brain he
may have,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;He slipped a stick
of dynamite into the stone bin at Number Three,
and now he says there are about forty tons of
crushed rock spilled on the track for the gasoline
car to climb over. And the car is not yet in
sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is better,&#8221; said David coolly. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
get around the obstruction, no doubt, but it will
hold them for a little while. Now for our part
of it. You once remarked that the law doesn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
reach this far from the nearest court-house. We
don&#8217;t know, officially, that these men are coming
as officers, and we&#8217;ll act upon that ignorance. You
go over to the bunk shacks and turn out a handful
of Brady&#8217;s day-shift men. Tell them to bring
pick-handles. Then go to the light plant and tell
the night engineer to listen for a pistol shot. If
he hears one, he is to pull the switch on the yard
circuit and leave us in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that the Lushing crowd won&#8217;t be able to
identify any of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that we shan&#8217;t be able to identify them&mdash;as
officers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once more I&#8217;m apologizing to you,&#8221; said
Plegg, in mild irony. &#8220;Anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, except that you are to pick your
men, and let it be understood that the raiders are
after Mr. Grillage and me. If you pick the right
men, they&#8217;ll fight for that. I&#8217;ll run over to the
<i>Athenia</i> and get Mr. Grillage out of the way. I
don&#8217;t want to have him mixed up in this, even
by implication.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Plegg went one way, David went the other,
hurrying across to the private Pullman, which he
knew was occupied because it was lighted. When
he pushed through the vestibule swing-door he
found the contractor-king poring over an estimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
sheet. Taken for an instant off his guard, the
big man looked haggard and care-worn. It was
this that made David begin with a sober protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You put in too many hours down here, Mr.
Grillage,&#8221; he said, much as he might have said it
to his own father. &#8220;How about that fishing trip
you were going to take with Dad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going, pretty soon, now,&#8221; was the gruff
reply. And then: &#8220;David, you&#8217;re right; I&#8217;ve got
too darned many irons in the fire, and some of
&#8217;em get too hot, and some of &#8217;em freeze. Hurry
up and get through with this Short Line crucifixion,
so you can take hold and blow some of
the other bellowses for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Crucifixion&#8217; is right!&#8221; said David, with a
workmanlike scowl. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t worried you much
about the job lately, but the railroad people&mdash;with
Lushing egging them on, of course&mdash;have
been mighty active for the past few days&mdash;perniciously
active, I&#8217;d say. I didn&#8217;t know what was
up until just now; though I&#8217;ve been ready for
anything. It seems they&#8217;ve been trying to find
a peg upon which to hang a legal fight, and they
think they&#8217;ve found it&mdash;just what sort of a peg,
I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Legal, you say; do you mean criminal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plegg thinks it may be; based on alleged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
jerry-work on the bridges, or something of that
sort. Anyhow, Lushing is on his way up here
with a gang of subsidized deputies, and Crawford
telephones that the object of the raid is to arrest
you and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted the giant, straightening himself
in his chair. &#8220;Going to try that, is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So Crawford says. I came to ask you to go
up to the hotel and let me handle it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some few days ago I met Lushing and we had
a&mdash;er&mdash;well, a little disagreement, you might call
it. He&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard about it,&#8221; interrupted the boss of
bosses, with a satisfied grin. &#8220;You beat him up
and warned him to stay off the job if he wanted
to keep his hide whole. I owe you something for
that, David; it did me a whole lot of good. But
go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plegg&#8217;s getting a few of Brady&#8217;s Irishmen together,
and we&#8217;ll take care of these raiders. We
don&#8217;t know, in any legal way, that they are deputies,
and we shall act accordingly. What I need
is to get you out of it; so far out that you won&#8217;t
know anything about it, if any one should ask
you after the fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eben Grillage gripped the edge of his desk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
with both hands and pulled himself out of his
chair. David marked the forced muscle-strain
that went into the effort, and immediately saw a
curious change come over the massive face with
its staring eyes and hanging, dewlap jaws.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run away from a fight, David? I guess&mdash;it
would be the&mdash;first&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>David leaped, and was in time to ease the big
body back into the swing-chair before it could
crumple and fall. For a few seconds Eben Grillage
sat motionless, purple-faced and gasping.
Then he reached into a desk drawer, found some
tablets in a druggist&#8217;s box, and swallowed one.
The effect was almost instantaneous.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, now, David,&#8221; he mumbled, a bit
thickly; &#8220;just a little spell. But it&#8217;s telling me
that my fighting days are over, I guess. Lucky
I&#8217;ve got you, my boy. Stick me up on the hill
path, and I&#8217;ll keep out of your way and give you
a free hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>David did more than was required. Precious
as time might be, he went all the way to the Inn
with his charge, and at the leave-taking laid filial
commands upon the man whose right to command
him he had never questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;This settles it, Mr. Grillage,&#8221; he protested
warmly. &#8220;To-morrow you&#8217;ll take Dad and your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
fishing tackle and get out of here&mdash;go away and
stay away until we get this railroad snarl straightened
out. Go on in, now, and go to bed. Plegg
and I will do the needful.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this parting injunction he fled down the
ridge path and took command of the little group
of huskies that Plegg had assembled beside the
bunk car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any more news?&#8221; he demanded; and Plegg
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another &#8217;phone from Crawford. He is blockaded
in the Number Three bridge office shack,
but he got a bit of talk through before they cut
his &#8217;phone wire. Lushing has taken our night
shift off the bridge and set it at work shoveling
the crushed stone off the track. Tommy says they
will be able to get through with their gas-car
within the next few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. We won&#8217;t wait for them,&#8221; said David
quickly. &#8220;Get that engine up there at the coal
chute, and couple an empty flat-car ahead of it,
and another behind it. Hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>The order was carried out briskly, and when
the oddly made up train slowed to a stand beside
the bunk car, the pick-handle squad climbed upon
the rearward car, and the chief and his first assistant
sprang into the engine cab. &#8220;Down the line!&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
was David&#8217;s order to the engine-driver, and the
train moved off, gathering such momentum as the
roughly surfaced construction track permitted.</p>

<p>In the make-up of the train the engine was
backing, with an empty flat-car for its pilot. Being
a construction machine, the locomotive had a
headlight at either end. With the yard switches
left behind, David reached up, uncoiled the short
signal-bell cord, and shouted into the ear of the
big Irishman at the throttle. &#8220;Listen, Callahan:
I&#8217;m going up on the coal to keep a lookout and
flag for you. If I give you one bell, clamp your
brakes and make an emergency stop; if I give you
two bells, let her have all she will take. Understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Irishman nodded; and David, with Plegg
at his heels, climbed over the coal to a lookout
position on the rear end of the tender. By this
time the scenery, or so much of it as the starlight
revealed, was unreeling itself rapidly on either
hand, and in the beam of the tender-carried headlight
the straight-away stretches of the track
rushed up in quick succession to be shot to the
rear under the roaring wheels. &#8220;Lord!&#8221; yelped
Plegg; &#8220;if we should meet &#8217;em on a curve!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
but David Vallory made no reply. He was gripping
the bell-cord and staring steadily down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
track ahead, following the double line of rails to
the farthest reach of the spreading cone of light.</p>

<p>As it chanced, the meeting point with the gasoline-driven
push-car was not on a curve. On the
mile-long tangent which marked the approach to
bridge Number Three the converging lines of
the rails in the distance met in a dark blot; a
moving blot that shot quickly into the glare of
the headlight. Plegg saw a series of black dots
tumbling grotesquely from the blot to right and
left, heard a sharp double clang of the signal in
the cab behind him, and felt the sudden lurch of
the tender as the engine&#8217;s throttle was opened.
&#8220;<i>Duck!</i>&#8221; was the command shouted in his ear,
and the next instant there was a crash and the
air was filled with flying wreckage.</p>

<p>Luckily, no wheel of the attacking train was
derailed, and a minute or so later, Callahan, in
obedience to a signal from his chief, was braking
the heavy &#8220;mogul&#8221; to a stop beside Crawford&#8217;s
dynamited rock pile. The place was light with
flares, the concrete-pouring on the bridge had been
resumed, and Crawford came down the staging
runway with a broad grin on his boyish face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a little of it from the far end of the
staging,&#8221; he chuckled. &#8220;How many of &#8217;em did
you get?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>&#8220;Not any of them, I hope,&#8221; said David Vallory
soberly, as he swung down from the engine
step. &#8220;It was meant for an object-lesson&mdash;not a
murder. Now talk fast, Crawford: how many
of them are there, and who are they?&mdash;besides
Lushing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven in all, besides the boss-devil; and they
looked to me like Brewster toughs, or hold-up
men, or something of that sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Armed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&mdash;one of &#8217;em ran me off the staging with
a gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brewster toughs, you say?&mdash;are you sure they
are not Powder Can toughs? Lushing would
have to take them to Brewster to have them
sworn in as deputies&mdash;which would account for
their coming from down the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By George&mdash;that&#8217;s so! I did see a bunch of
plug-uglies going down on the stub train yesterday,
come to think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory turned upon Plegg. &#8220;There
you are,&#8221; he said. And then to Crawford: &#8220;We
are going back to headquarters now, and maybe
they&#8217;ll give us a scrap as we go by, and maybe
they won&#8217;t. If they don&#8217;t show up for us, they
may come down here and make trouble for you.
How about that?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take my chances,&#8221; returned the bridge expert
cheerfully. &#8220;I have my old pump-gun now;
it was in the office shack, and I didn&#8217;t have sense
enough to go and get it before they came up and
fell on me. I&#8217;ll stand &#8217;em off, all right, if they
try to stop the job again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said one of them came to you at Number
One to borrow a monkey-wrench: what did
he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was just joshing me a few lines while I
was looking for the wrench; said I wouldn&#8217;t have
any bosses to-morrow, because they&#8217;d both be in
jail. I asked him who he meant by &#8216;both&#8217;, and
he said, &#8216;the big one and the little one.&#8217; I took
that to mean you and Mr. Grillage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You probably guessed right; but the man was
a liar. We are not going to jail&mdash;any of us.
And before I forget it: you&#8217;ve done a good job
to-night, Crawford, and I shall see to it that you
get credit where it will do you the most good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need any credit; it&#8217;s all in the day&#8217;s
work,&#8221; laughed the cheerful bridge builder; then,
as his chief was turning to climb into Callahan&#8217;s
cab: &#8220;Oh, say&mdash;I meant to ask you: have you
seen Lushing since you&mdash;er&mdash;since he went into
retirement a few days ago? He&#8217;s a plumb sight!
You broke his nose; turned it around so it points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
east when he&#8217;s going north. Gee! but he looks
fierce!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ought to have been his neck,&#8221; was the brittle
rejoinder, and then the double-ended train
pulled out for the return.</p>

<p>There was no demonstration at the point where
the abandoned gasoline car had been demolished,
though David had the train stopped and got off
with his pick-handle squad to beat the covers.
The straight piece of track was on the river bank,
with a wooded hill on the left from which a few
determined snipers might have wrought havoc
with the beaters, but no man was found and no
shot was fired.</p>

<p>Plegg spoke of the probabilities as the train
proceeded up the valley.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are through with them for to-night,&#8221; was
his prediction. &#8220;It is eight miles to Powder Can
or the Gap, and only four to Agorda. They&#8217;ll
go east instead of west.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; David agreed; &#8220;now that they know
they can&#8217;t bluff us. That is what I meant to do;
turn the bluff the other way around. I guess we
did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first assistant, isolated in his seat on the
fireman&#8217;s box, held his peace until the train came
to the end of its run in the headquarters yard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
But on the way over to the bunk car with his
chief, he had a word to add, and added it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that Crawford has dumped the wheel-barrow
and spilled all the garden truck, I can
speak of a thing we&#8217;ve all known since the story
of your manhandling of Lushing drifted into
camp. Lushing is peacock-vain; no stage-door
johnnie was ever more so. Even when he was
here on the work he kept his mustaches curled,
his beard trimmed to a hair, and his clothes looking
as if he had just stepped out of a tailor&#8217;s shop.
You&#8217;ve spoiled his beauty for all time, and he&#8217;d
draw and quarter you for it if he could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, I hit him only once; it
was all the chance I had before his gun went off.
But I don&#8217;t care what I&#8217;ve done to his face, Plegg.
As I remarked to Crawford, I&#8217;m only sorry I
didn&#8217;t break his neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it would have been safer if you had,&#8221;
was the quiet suggestion. &#8220;As it is, he&#8217;ll never
forgive you, and he won&#8217;t be satisfied with any
light revenge. Which brings on more talk. I
have a notion that this &#8216;arrest&#8217; business to-night
was pure bunk. I don&#8217;t doubt that Lushing had
gone through all the forms and had sworn out
the warrants. Doubtless, he was going to make
a bluff at serving them. But, Vallory, I&#8217;ll bet a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
little round gold dollar with a hole in it that the
real play was to make you put up a fight so that
you might righteously be killed in resisting an
officer of the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again David said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; and Plegg
went on calmly. &#8220;If that is the play, we&#8217;ll have
to take measures accordingly. You mustn&#8217;t run
around on the job unless I&#8217;m with you. If you
will pardon me for saying it, you are not quite
quick enough on the draw, as yet; and you haven&#8217;t
learned to hold the other fellow&#8217;s eye while you&#8217;re
doing it. That is about all the difference there
is between living and dying when it comes to a
show-down, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had boarded the bunk car and were preparing
to turn in. David looked up from the
boot-unlacing and his eyes were bloodshot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn your grannying!&#8221; he flared out savagely.
&#8220;When I need a wet nurse I&#8217;ll advertise
for one!&#8221;</p>

<p>A few seconds later he looked up again, to
find Plegg chuckling softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil are you laughing at?&#8221; he
snapped.</p>

<p>The chuckle expanded into the first assistant&#8217;s
slow, half-cynical smile. &#8220;And once, not so many
months ago, I was idiotic enough to cherish the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
notion that you might be too good!&#8221; he exclaimed,
in mock self-derision. And with that, he rolled
himself in his blankets and turned his face from
the light.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIII<br />


The Killer</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the morning following the raid which had
failed to connect, Eben Grillage carried out
his promise to side-track business and go a-fishing.
David made the necessary arrangements, stocking
the <i>Athenia&#8217;s</i> larder with provisions from the
camp commissary, borrowing a tent and camping
outfit from one of the grade subcontractors, and
otherwise bestirring himself to expedite the departure
of the anglers.</p>

<p>With the <i>Athenia</i> out of its berth and safely
on its way to some unannounced destination in
the upper Timanyoni, a handicap of a sort was
removed; a handicap and a restriction. As David
phrased it for Plegg, he had gotten two non-combatants
out of the range of the guns and the
field was now clear for whatever battle of reprisals
might be threatening.</p>

<p>Of the restriction removed he said nothing to
Plegg or to any one. There be certain secret
curtains of the heart which are not to be drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
aside for alien eyes to view what may lie behind
them; and as yet, not even to himself would David
admit that he was no longer able to see eye
to eye with his father. None the less, it was with
a distinct sense of relief that he waved good-by
to the pair standing on the rear platform of the
private Pullman as Callahan&#8217;s &#8220;mogul&#8221; snaked it
out through the yard to make a flying-switch
coupling with the outgoing stub train.</p>

<p>It was on this same morning that Plegg reported
for the third time his inability to find the
man Backus, and the report was made while he
and Vallory were climbing the mountain on their
way to make an inspecting tour of the western
slope activities, including the tunnel drift which
was slowly gnawing its way to meet Regnier&#8217;s
bore from the eastward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a dozen &#8216;trusties&#8217; looking for him
and they have combed Powder Can and every
other mining-camp in a ten-mile radius,&#8221; was
Plegg&#8217;s summing-up of the search. &#8220;He has
disappeared as completely as if the earth had
swallowed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could only be sure that the earth <i>has</i>
swallowed him,&#8221; growled the one for whom the
restrictions had been removed. &#8220;But there is
another fork to that road, Plegg. Maybe Lushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
has him hidden out somewhere. Had you
thought of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; that seemed to be the most reasonable
explanation of his disappearance. But in a very
short time I discovered that Lushing was also
looking for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite sure. I have it from a number of different
sources. He has even gone so far as to
offer a reward&mdash;not publicly, of course, but the
word has been passed among our workmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which means that Lushing knows Backus has
something to sell. We mustn&#8217;t let Lushing beat
us to it, Plegg. You haven&#8217;t stopped your investigating
machine, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. I have even gone Lushing one
better and raised his bet on the reward&mdash;though
you didn&#8217;t authorize me to spend any real money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did right; and I&#8217;ll see to it that the
money is forthcoming when it is needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the matter rested for the time, and the
two men spent the entire day on the western slope,
tramping over the work on the desert cut-off, visiting
the sub-headquarters in Lost Creek basin,
and taking the lost motion out of the job wherever
it was found. Cartwright, the sub-chief in
general charge of the over-mountain work, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
making good progress, though he, too, complained
bitterly of the obstructing activities of the railroad
inspection staff. Lushing, as it appeared,
had not yet been over the range since his return
from the East, and Cartwright, a nervous little
man with a harsh voice and a choleric eye, was
explosively profane when he was told the story
of the raid that failed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of us will have to &#8216;get&#8217; that beggar
yet, Vallory!&#8221; he rasped. &#8220;It&#8217;s gone a long way
past any business vigilance on his part; he is simply
a vindictive scoundrel, and he is making a
personal fight upon the entire Grillage outfit. If
he shows up on this side of the range, he&#8217;d better
bring a bodyguard with him; that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got
to say!&#8221;</p>

<p>On the return from the desert inspection, David
and his first assistant had supper at Cartwright&#8217;s
headquarters on Lost Creek, and afterward
crossed the mountain by starlight. Plegg
dropped out of the procession of two on the descent
to the eastern tunnel entrance, ostensibly
to see how Regnier was getting along, but really
because the dangerous roof drew him with a
mysterious fascination that was always making
him go out of his way to take another look
at it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>David Vallory kept on down the mountain
alone, and in due time, with a number of brief
pauses at the various working points, tramped
into the Powder Gap yard at an hour not far
from midnight. Learning from the yard boss
that there had been no new developments during
the day, he went across to the bunk car and let
himself in. There was a fragrance of good tobacco
smoke in the darkened interior, and as he
struck a light he was wondering what member of
the staff had been making free with Plegg&#8217;s carefully
hoarded store of &#8220;perfectos.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not until after he had snapped the lamp
chimney into place, and was turning the wick to
its proper height, that he had a shock that sent
his hand quickly to the grip of the weapon slung
by its shoulder-strap under his coat. Sitting
quietly on Plegg&#8217;s bunk, and still smoking the
cigar which had perfumed the stuffy interior of
the little car, was the swarthy, cold-eyed master
gambler of Powder Can.</p>

<p>Dargin was the first to break the surcharged
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been waiting for you,&#8221; he said shortly; and
then: &#8220;You needn&#8217;t be feelin&#8217; for that gun. If
I&#8217;d wanted to croak you, you&#8217;d &#8217;ve been dead a
whole half-minute ago.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>David Vallory sat down on his own bed, the
shock spasm subsiding a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I haven&#8217;t kept you waiting very long,&#8221;
he ventured, not too inhospitably.</p>

<p>&#8220;About a half-hour. But I had some smokes
in my poke, and the waiting didn&#8217;t cut any ice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hastily David passed in review the various
reasons why Dargin should come thus to lie in
wait for him. There were two and possibly three;
all of them warlike if Dargin chose to hold them
so: the attempt to abate the man-traps, the attempt
to persuade Judith Fallon to leave Powder
Can, and for the third, the assumption that Dargin
was in a partnership of some sort with Lushing.
In the new recklessness which had come to
him with the other transformations, he attacked
the reasons boldly in their order.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a kick coming, Dargin, if you
want to make it,&#8221; he began brusquely. &#8220;I&#8217;m out
to wipe your Powder Can speak-easys off the map
if I can swing the big stick hard enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was onto that a month ago,&#8221; was the growling
answer. Then, after a deep pull at the fragrant
cigar: &#8220;I reckon they ought to be wiped
out&mdash;though that ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217; that I wouldn&#8217;t take
a crack at the man that did it when it came to a
show-down.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>&#8220;If you think the place ought to be cleaned up,
why don&#8217;t you do it yourself?&#8221; David shot back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Maybe I will, some day&mdash;if you don&#8217;t
beat me to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if I should beat you to it, I suppose you&#8217;ll
come after me with a gun. Is that the way of
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The shadow that flitted across the swarthy face
of the man on the opposite bunk was scarcely a
smile, though possibly it was intended for one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might; but it&#8217;d be a heap like takin&#8217; candy
from a baby. You ain&#8217;t been carryin&#8217; a gun long
enough to get the hang of it. You&#8217;re a whole
lot too slow to make it interestin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said David; &#8220;we&#8217;ll pass that up.
The next thing may get a bit nearer to you. Judith
Fallon has doubtless told you that she knew me
back East, and that we went to school together
and were good friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh-huh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But perhaps she hasn&#8217;t told you that I have
tried to persuade her to break off with you and
leave Powder Can?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; she ain&#8217;t told me anything like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s so; I did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For common decency&#8217;s sake. If you admit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
that the mining-camp dives ought to be wiped
out, you&#8217;ll also have to admit the facts concerning
that girl. I know you&#8217;ve been befriending her
honestly&mdash;the only mistake you made was in not
putting a bullet through Tom Judson before you
turned him loose&mdash;but you must know that a man
of your stripe can&#8217;t befriend any woman without
making her pay the penalty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man of my stripe, eh?&mdash;well, I reckon that&#8217;s
so, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are not here to pick a quarrel with
me over Judith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell, no; not in a thousand years!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what did you come for? Did Lushing
send you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim Lushing? He can&#8217;t send me nowhere.
He ain&#8217;t got the insides.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory had reached the end of his resources.
There was apparently nothing for it
but to wait patiently until Dargin was ready to
disclose the object of the midnight visit; and he
seemed to be in no manner of haste.</p>

<p>David unbuckled his uncomfortable weapon
and tossed it aside. &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of any other
grouch that you might have,&#8221; he said, with the
nearest approach to his former good-natured
smile that he had been able to achieve since the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
moon of Virginia Grillage&#8217;s favor had gone into
eclipse for him. Then he dug into Plegg&#8217;s locker
and brought out the first assistant&#8217;s cherished box
of &#8220;perfectos.&#8221; &#8220;Your smoke is about used up;
have another,&#8221; he offered.</p>

<p>Dargin helped himself, and took the lighted
match that David held out to him. Then the
flitting shadow that passed for a smile began at
the corners of the hard-bitted mouth and crept
slowly up to the murderous eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m stuck on your nerve, Dave Vallory&mdash;damned
if I ain&#8217;t!&#8221; he grated. &#8220;If you could
only draw a fraction quicker and shoot as plumb
straight as you can talk, you&#8217;d be some man.
Now I&#8217;ll spill what I mogged over here to spill:
ever hear of a duck named Backus?&mdash;Simmy
Backus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he used to pipe off the easy marks for
me&mdash;same time he was working for you-all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lose him, and you&#8217;ve been lookin&#8217; for
him, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh-huh; I thought so. Know why you
couldn&#8217;t find him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>&#8220;Well, I can tell you, I reckon. I had him
hid out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hid out? locked up, you mean? Why did
you do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he&#8217;s a worm. He was aimin&#8217; to give
you the double-cross: tried to sell me a chance
on it. I didn&#8217;t hate you-all bad enough to let him
run loose; see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that straight, Dargin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Straight as a string.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they tell me that you and Lushing have a
stand-in together; and Lushing hates us heartily
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe so; and maybe we have got a stand-in.
But that ain&#8217;t no skin off&#8217;m this other thing.
Backus is a worm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you don&#8217;t like worms. I have a
feeling that way, myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The master gambler got up and pushed his
soft hat back to allow the forelock of Indian-black
hair to fall over his brow. As he was moving
to the door, he said, &#8220;Reckon that&#8217;s about all
I had to spill&mdash;all but one little thing: that damn&#8217;
worm&#8217;s done dug him a hole and crawled out.
Thought maybe you&#8217;d like to know. So long,&#8221;
and he was gone.</p>

<p>For a long time after he was left alone, David<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
Vallory sat on the edge of his bed, buried in
thought. With the spy, Backus, at large, it was
only a question of time when Lushing would have
another weapon in his hands. In odd moments
David had made an estimate on the cost of shooting
down the menace in the eastern tunnel drifting
and concreting the gash which would be left
by the blasting out of the fissure material. The
figures were appalling. Not only would the
profits on the entire contract be likely to disappear
in the chasm; there was a chance that there
would be a huge loss, as well, since nobody could
tell how much of the fissure contents would come
down in the blasting. As Eben Grillage had
frankly confessed, the line-shortening job had
been taken on a narrow margin, and there had
been no provision made for untoward happenings.</p>

<p>There was but one conclusion to be reached,
and by this time David Vallory had passed all
the mile-stones of hesitancy. Backus, the worm,
must be found and silenced, and there must be no
fumbling delay in either half of the undertaking.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIV<br />


No Thoroughfare</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT the departure of the two fishermen, Virginia
Grillage had taken Lucille Vallory
under her wing, closing the cottage under the
pines and taking the blind girl to the hotel. This
left Oswald more or less unattached. Since there
was no welcome for him at the foot of the ridge,
and David had not even taken the trouble to introduce
him to the members of the engineering
staff, he spent the greater part of his time at the
Inn, devoting himself, so far as Miss Grillage
would permit it, to the care and comfort of the
helpless one, and taking his meals in due submission
at a table with Miss Virginia and her charge,
the Englishman, and the heir of profitable breakfast-foods.</p>

<p>Beneath these routine time-killings, days in
which nothing transpired to break the monotonous
round of eating and sleeping and lounging
upon the shaded porches of the Inn, Oswald fancied
he could feel the tension of an approaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
crisis. To a keen-eyed young lawyer whose profession
led logically to a study of the human problem
in all its phases, the premonitory signs emphasized
themselves. Miss Virginia, apparently
engrossed in her favorite pastime of playing off
one man against another, struck a false note now
and then; young Wishart was occasionally jogged
out of his customary rut of good-natured indolence;
and even the imperturbable Englishman
was losing the fine edge of a carefully cultivated
Old-World indifference to his surroundings.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these indications, it was Lucille
Vallory who first put the impending threat
into words, confiding in Oswald one evening when
Virginia Grillage had gone for a stroll along the
ridge accompanied by her two shadows.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Herbert?&#8221; the blind girl asked;
&#8220;what is happening to us all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What should be happening?&#8221; he evaded.
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you enjoying yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I mean,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;Nothing
is the same any more; I can feel it. You are
troubled about something, and so is Virginia. No,
it isn&#8217;t anything that either of you say; it&#8217;s just
how you feel inside. And Davie; he is different,
too&mdash;so cruelly different. Is it because he is worried
about his work?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>Oswald said what there was to be said, doing
violence to his own convictions in an effort to
shield the loved one. There was nothing for
anybody to be troubled about, he told her; and
David&mdash;she must remember that David was now
at the head of an immense undertaking and was
carrying a heavy load of responsibility. She was
silenced, but he could see that his well-meant effort
had been thrown away.</p>

<p>This happened on an evening when the two
fishermen had been three days in the wilds of the
upper Timanyoni. On the next morning the monotonies
were broken. Little gossip of the big
job penetrated to the Alta Vista, the summerers,
as a rule, being content to hold the great engineering
feat as a part of the scenic stage-effect
for which they paid in their hotel bills. But on
the morning in question, when Cumberleigh had
joined a sunrise peak-climbing party, and Wishart
was not yet out of bed, there was news of a small
catastrophe. Oswald had the story from one of
the Alta Vista clerks as he was getting his morning
mail. Some time during the night an accident
had happened in the big tunnel. In one of the
blasts a man had been blown up and desperately
hurt. A Brewster doctor had been telegraphed
for and was coming up on a special train.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>Oswald was interested only casually, and he
saw no special significance in the added word particularizing
the injured man as one of the railroad
company&#8217;s inspectors. As he was crossing the
lobby he met Miss Virginia. Though she was
apparently just down from her rooms and on
her way to breakfast, her first word was of the
tragedy, or near-tragedy, in the tunnel.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have heard of the accident to Mr. Strayer?&#8221;
she asked hurriedly. And then: &#8220;Have you
seen David this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>Oswald answered both queries in a single sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard of the accident&mdash;the clerk was
just this minute telling me about it: and I haven&#8217;t
seen David.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Virginia was plainly anxious and disturbed
She hesitated for a moment, a little
frown coming and going between the straight-browed
eyes, and Oswald noted that she was
nervously twisting a bit of paper between her
fingers. &#8220;I must see David&mdash;at once,&#8221; she said,
half as if she were thinking aloud. &#8220;May I ask
you to go and tell him so, Herbert?&#8221;</p>

<p>Since Virginia had shown herself more than
friendly in his own trying involvement, Oswald
consented willingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find him for you,&#8221; he promised; and a
minute later he was on his way down to the construction
yard.</p>

<p>It so happened that he had to go no farther
than to the office bunk car. The door was open
and he went in. David Vallory was sitting behind
the small mapping-table, checking dimensions
on a set of blue-prints. At the sound of Oswald&#8217;s
footsteps he looked up with a scowl of impatience,
and his greeting was a challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, is it? I&#8217;ve been thinking it was
about time you were showing up. When do you
start back to Middleboro?&#8221;</p>

<p>Oswald ignored the ungracious demand and
said what he had been sent to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Virginia is at the hotel, and she wishes
to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t inquire. She asked me to find you
and deliver her message. I have done both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go just now; I&#8217;m, busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll wait for you,&#8221; said Oswald coolly,
and he sat down on Plegg&#8217;s bunk, found a cigarette
in his pocket case and lighted it.</p>

<p>In sheer perversity, as it seemed to the young
lawyer, David went on shuffling the blue-prints
and making figures on a pad under his hand. Oswald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
waited in silence and in due time had his
reward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be half-way decent about it, Bert, and tell me
what I&#8217;m wanted for,&#8221; said the figure-maker,
looking up suddenly from his work. &#8220;She has
Cumberleigh and Wishart; aren&#8217;t they enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>Oswald&#8217;s smile was a palpable easing of strains.
If David&#8217;s malady were nothing worse than a fit
of jealousy, it was not necessarily incurable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wondering, before I came out here,
what Vinnie might be doing to you,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You wrote us that she and her father were here,
if you remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What she did to me was done more than a
year ago, if you care to know. But you haven&#8217;t
answered my question. What does she want of
me this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t know, David.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you see her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the hotel lobby; she was on her way to
the breakfast-room, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the other two?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cumberleigh has gone to climb Qojogo with
a sunrise party, and Wishart hasn&#8217;t turned out
yet. Half of the time he is never visible before
noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she say?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>&#8220;She asked first if I had heard of the accident
in the tunnel last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more David Vallory bent over the table
and busied himself with the figure-making.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard of it, I suppose?&#8221; he offered,
without looking up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only in passing. The hotel clerk told me
that a man was hurt; in one of the blasts, I think
he said.&#8221;</p>

<p>David pushed his work aside as one who faces
the guns only because he must. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go,&#8221; he
consented shortly; and together they walked
through the yard and climbed the ridge.</p>

<p>Miss Virginia was waiting on one of the
porches when the pair crossed the painfully cared-for
bit of greensward in front of the Inn. Oswald,
telling himself that he had done his part,
went on through to the breakfast-room, leaving
David to fight his battle&mdash;if there were to be a
battle&mdash;alone. The young woman&#8217;s first question
was as direct as it was unexpected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have you been avoiding me so persistently?&#8221;
she asked, making room for the summoned
one to sit beside her on the settee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it was because I had just sense
enough to see that I had served my turn and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
wasn&#8217;t needed any more,&#8221; he answered in a tone
that might have been copied faithfully from the
king of the contractors in his most brittle mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silly!&#8221; she chided, with a strained little laugh.
&#8220;I could forgive you for saying such a thing as
that if you were only sincere. It isn&#8217;t Cumberleigh
and Freddy Wishart, David; it&#8217;s yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wrote and told them where you were,&#8221;
he accused.</p>

<p>&#8220;As it happens, I did not. But you needn&#8217;t
try to hide behind a shadow&mdash;or two shadows.
You have had other reasons for avoiding me.
For one thing, you have met Mr. Lushing, and
you have quarreled with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody seems to know that,&#8221; he complained.
&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For another thing, you have determined, in
spite of all that we have talked about, to fight
Mr. Lushing with his own weapons.&#8221;</p>

<p>This seemed to be too accurate to be classed
with the shrewd guesses, and he accused her
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been prying into Plegg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen Mr. Plegg in weeks; I haven&#8217;t
been prying into any one, and I haven&#8217;t needed
to. You have been showing very plainly that you
have broken with the ideals&mdash;all of them. Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
couldn&#8217;t you stay up on the pedestal, David? It
was such a nice pedestal!&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed mirthlessly. &#8220;You are such a queer
mixture of good, hard sense and back-number romanticism,&#8221;
he commented. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you realize
that I&#8217;ve got to be a man among men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what you ought to be&mdash;in the other
and better meaning of the phrase. You won&#8217;t
make a very successful villain, David.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not; but I shall try mighty hard not
to let the other man make a wooden Indian of
me,&#8221; he returned grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you haven&#8217;t stopped, even at&mdash;murder.&#8221;
She shuddered over the final word, but she would
not qualify it.</p>

<p>He was regarding her through half-closed eyes.
&#8220;Having said that much, you ought to say more,
don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to say more; lots more. That man
in the tunnel last night: he wasn&#8217;t blown up by a
blast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know he wasn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of your men carried or dragged him half-way
to the mouth of the tunnel before the blast
was fired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he prompted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It comes to this; either it was a sheer accident&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
stone falling from the roof&mdash;or there was
foul play. Mr. Lushing says it was foul play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lushing? You don&#8217;t mean to say that he has
had the brazen effrontery to come to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he didn&#8217;t come here. He sent me a note;
an unsigned note, because he is a coward. He
did it once before, when he was dis&mdash;when he
left the Grillage Company. He says you will be
tried for murder if the man dies, and he throws
it in my face.&#8221;</p>

<p>David got upon his feet rather unsteadily, but
the unsteadiness was of rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t any murder last night, but there
is going to be one when I can find this man who
writes anonymous letters to you!&#8221; he broke out.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; sit down again, please. I am not nearly
through. It makes very little difference what Mr.
Lushing, or anybody else, may write or say to
me, David; but there are other things that do
make a world of difference. What special thing
is there in that tunnel that you don&#8217;t want Mr.
Lushing or his engineers to find out?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at her gloomily. &#8220;If you were your
father&#8217;s son instead of his daughter, I might tell
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will tell me anyhow,&#8221; she declared quickly.
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t, I shall find out for myself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>&#8220;I believe you are quite capable of it. But
there is nothing to be told more than I have already
told you. You may remember that I admitted
that there was a place in the tunnel that
may be called dangerous. If Lushing finds out
about it, he will immediately insist that it is dangerous,
and the railroad people will make us
spend a lot of money needlessly. Your father
didn&#8217;t put me here to bankrupt the Grillage Engineering
Company, Vinnie.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ignored the clause in condonation.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, accordingly, you have given orders to our
men to have an accident happen if the secret seems
likely to be discovered. This is simply horrible,
David!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is rather primitive, I&#8217;ll admit. But it&#8217;s
business&mdash;in the modern meaning of the word.
More than that, I owe it to your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t owe him <i>anything</i> that ought to be
paid with such a frightful price! What ought to
be done with that place in the tunnel? What
would be done if you were not blind to everything
but profit and loss?&#8221;</p>

<p>David shrugged his shoulders and turned his
face away. &#8220;I suppose the bad piece of roof
would be shot down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are deliberately allowing it to stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
up&mdash;if it will&mdash;and endangering the lives of your
workmen every hour of the day and night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard-rock men always take a chance. It is a
part of their trade. And Regnier, or some other
member of the staff, is always there to take it
with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are hopeless&mdash;absolutely and utterly
hopeless, David! Don&#8217;t you see what you are
forcing me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have some little conscience, if you haven&#8217;t.
I can&#8217;t say anything to Mr. Lushing, of course,
and I wouldn&#8217;t if I could. But I can write to
Mr. Maxwell, the general manager of the railroad
at Brewster. It so happens that I know
him, and his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on; you wouldn&#8217;t do anything like that!
Think a minute of the position in which it would
place your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head despairingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You drive me into a corner and then beat
me!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It is all wrong, wrong! And
you have broken my heart, David, because I
thought you were different. You lay this horrible
burden upon me one minute, and tie my hands
the next. What if this man who was hurt last
night should die?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>&#8220;He won&#8217;t die; but neither will he talk,&#8221; was
the gritting reply.</p>

<p>The young woman had risen and her color was
coming and going in hot little flashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think because I am my father&#8217;s daughter
you are safe in saying anything you please, and
in going on in any hard-hearted way you choose!
It is what I might have expected of a man who
would deny his only sister her one little chance
of happiness. You are worse than other men,
because you know the right way and you won&#8217;t
walk in it!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang up suddenly and caught her hands
in both of his.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Vinnie; I do know better.
Every word you have been saying has cut like a
knife!&#8221; he burst out, smashing all the barriers of
insincerity at a single blow. &#8220;I know where I
stand, and what I&#8217;ve been doing, and I have been
a conscious hypocrite every time I have pleaded
the way of the world as my excuse. But a man
<i>must</i> be loyal to something. For the obligation,
the immense obligation, I owe your father. I have
put my hands between his knees as the old-time
vassals used to do, and sworn to make his cause
my cause. He knows about that bad tunnel roof;
knows more than I do; and when I spoke to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
he told me to forget it. I can&#8217;t be disloyal to him&mdash;and
keep even a thief&#8217;s sense of honor!&#8221;</p>

<p>She released her hands quickly. It was early
for any of the porch loungers to be out, but they
were standing fairly in front of the lobby windows.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is better; much better,&#8221; she commended
with a little sigh. &#8220;I thought you were gone,
David; honestly, I was afraid that the good old
David I used to know and&mdash;and think a lot of&mdash;was
dead and buried&mdash;and it hurt me as much
as it would if you had been my own brother.
Now, if I could only forget what happened last
night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may set your mind at rest about Strayer,&#8221;
he put in quickly. &#8220;He won&#8217;t die; and he wasn&#8217;t
assaulted, as you seem to think he was, though I
won&#8217;t say what might or might not have happened
in another minute or two. He was testing
the bad roof with the point of an iron bar, and
a loose rock came down upon his head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But now you will pull the roof down, or timber
it, or do whatever is needful to make it safe?&#8221;
she said, half pleading with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; my hands are tied, too. I can&#8217;t saddle
the company with the added expense after your
father has told me in so many words to let it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
alone. Neither must I let Lushing find out and
force it upon him if I can help it. We must just
trust to luck, Vinnie; there is no help for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is going to be help for it,&#8221; she asserted,
with true Grillage resolution. Then: &#8220;One more
word before you go, David: you won&#8217;t fi&mdash;quarrel
with Mr. Lushing again?&#8221;</p>

<p>But at this his eyes grew hard. &#8220;I owe him
something more, now, for that anonymous letter.
Besides, he&#8217;s out for my scalp, personally, and I
shall certainly try to hold up my end if he starts
anything. You can&#8217;t blame me for that, Vinnie.
But that is a future. There is Wishart coming
out of the breakfast-room, and I suppose he is
looking for you. Anyway, my job is yelling for
me and I must go. Don&#8217;t you worry a single
minute about anything; do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even about Herbert and Lucille?&#8221; she
threw in quickly, as one thrusts an antagonist who
is helplessly off his guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, say; that isn&#8217;t fair!&#8221; he retorted, with a
frown that turned itself into a grin in spite of
the reluctances. &#8220;I&#8217;m right about Bert and the
little sister&mdash;I&#8217;m practically certain I am; but
you&#8217;ve got me going, and you know it. Do whatever
you think is best. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>What Miss Virginia thought was best was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
to stay and meet the short-sighted heir of the
breakfast-foods who was rambling aimlessly in
her direction. Instead, she went into the lobby
and sent a telegram. It was addressed to her
father at Red Butte, and it was short and to the
point:</p>

Cataclysmic</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NOTWITHSTANDING his chief&#8217;s angry
assertion that he did not need safeguarding,
Silas Plegg had contrived to keep track of
the goings and comings of &#8220;the little big boss&#8221; on
the job, and his vigilance was increased after the
near-tragedy in the tunnel. The gossip of the
camps made much of the little war which had developed
between the Grillage Company&#8217;s chief
and Lushing, and it was quickly passed from lip to
lip that the enmity between the two men had now
become actively and vindictively personal; had,
in the phrase of the unfettered desert country,
reached the stage in which each was &#8220;looking&#8221;
for the other with vengeful intent. In spite of
the assertion, often repeated and as often contradicted,
that Strayer&#8217;s injury was purely the result
of an unlucky accident, there were many to
speak of it with an eyelid drooped, and to intimate
that Lushing would go far to even up the account
with David Vallory, an account which carried its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
largest debit item in the blow which had disfigured
him.</p>

<p>For Plegg there was a small lessening of one
of the many stresses when David, on the day after
the accident, had modified the order given in the
battle night when he had so promptly backslidden
into the field of things elemental.</p>

<p>&#8220;About keeping that tunnel situation dark,
Plegg: I&#8217;ve been thinking that some of our men
might take me too literally&mdash;that possibly you
did,&#8221; was the way the modifying clause was introduced.
&#8220;I was pretty savage that night. I
told you that Lushing shot at me, but let you
infer that he missed. It was a miss, but it wouldn&#8217;t
have been if my field-note book hadn&#8217;t turned the
bullet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw the hole in your coat afterwards,&#8221; said
Plegg quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; the shock stopped the clock for me, and
the gambling house people carried me out for
dead&mdash;thought I was dead. Naturally, when the
clock got to running again, I was hot; was still
pretty warm when I talked with you at Brady&#8217;s.
Of course, I didn&#8217;t mean to convey the idea that
Lushing, or any member of his staff, was to be
massacred out of hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; the first assistant agreed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
readily enough. &#8220;But we are not to let them find
out about the &#8216;fault,&#8217; are we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if we can help it without going to extremes.
Mr. Grillage will be back before long,
and I&#8217;m going to put that tunnel-roof question up
to him again good and hard. I know what it will
mean to us if we have to dig that hollow tooth
out and fill it, but just the same, the responsibility
is getting too heavy for me, Plegg. It&#8217;s got so
I wake up in the night to think about it, and that&#8217;s
bad medicine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg offered no comment on this, but he made
haste to pass the word to Regnier that guile, and
not violence, was henceforth to be used in preserving
the secret of the bad roof. Shortly after
the word-passing Regnier had a deduction of his
own to proffer. It was to be inferred that the
secret had finally escaped, through the man
Backus, or otherwise, and that Strayer&#8217;s accident
had been taken as a warning. None of the railroad
inspectors were venturing into the tunnel
since Strayer had been injured, Regnier reported.</p>

<p>Beyond this, there was a plot of some sort
afoot, so Regnier told Plegg. An attempt had
been made to bribe one of the portal watchmen
posted to keep unauthorized visitors out of the
tunnel, and the briber was one of the Powder Can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
dive-keepers&mdash;not Dargin, but one of his concessionaries,
who was also known as &#8220;Black Jack.&#8221;
The watchman had proved incorruptible, and had
reported the attempt to Regnier. His story was
that he had been offered a certain sum of money
if he would find out when Vallory was to be in
the tunnel at any shift-changing time, and would
use the working telephone to notify the briber
beforehand.</p>

<p>Plegg said nothing of this to his chief, but it
made him doubly watchful. Also, it made him
fertile in excuses to keep Vallory from making
any but strictly unannounced visits to Heading
Number One. Time was all the first assistant
hoped to gain. It was reported that Mr. Grillage&#8217;s
private car was on its way back from Red
Butte, and there was the slender chance that, with
the president on the ground again, something
might be done to clear the air and quiet the various
gathering menaces.</p>

<p>This was the situation at the close of the day
when the private Pullman <i>Athenia</i> came in and
was shunted to its former position on the spur
track. At the moment of its arrival David Vallory
was making a tour of the lower camps.
Plegg was in the construction yard, and he saw
Eben Grillage and his fishing companion leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
the car and go up to the Inn together. And after
dinner he saw the king of the contractors come
back to the car alone. Later still, the first assistant,
smoking his pipe on the platform of the office
bunk car, saw a woman descending the path from
the hotel. Recognizing the big boss&#8217;s daughter,
Plegg dutifully went across the yard tracks to
meet her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Plegg,&#8221; she said, as he came
up. &#8220;I imagine I was just about to lose myself.
Whereabouts is the <i>Athenia</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you,&#8221; he offered, and he led her
around an obstructing material train and over to
the spur-track, where he helped her up the steps
of the private car. As he was lifting his hat to
go away she stopped him to ask a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you happen to know where Mr. Vallory
is?&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg gave such information as he had, or
thought he had: the chief was somewhere down
the line at one of the lower camps; or at least he
had gone down earlier in the evening and he had
not come back to supper. The young woman appeared
to be satisfied with the answer, and when
the porter had admitted her to her father&#8217;s car,
Plegg went his way, wondering if anything new
had developed. The conclusion was negative.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
Miss Virginia&#8217;s question was natural and casual;
one that need have no bearing upon the threatening
conditions&mdash;doubtless had none. But if he
could have been a listener at the door of the office
compartment in the <i>Athenia</i>, he would have
known better how much was at stake in the matter
of keeping in close touch with his chief&#8217;s
movements.</p>

<p>Miss Virginia found her father planted in his
great chair behind the glass-topped table-desk.
The fishing absence was responsible for a huge
accumulation of mail, and he was slitting the envelopes
with a nimble dexterity curiously at variance
with his massive bulk and knotty-knuckled,
square-fingered hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, little girl; you down here?&#8221; he rumbled;
and before she could speak: &#8220;I got your
wire&mdash;two days late. What is it?&mdash;something
that won&#8217;t keep until I have read my mail?&#8221;
Then, with a chuckling laugh: &#8220;Which one is it
you&#8217;re going to spring on me&mdash;Wishart, or the
&#8216;belted earl&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; she replied succinctly. &#8220;I have
come to talk business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho! business, is it? Well, I guess I&#8217;m a
business man. Go ahead and open up your
samples.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>&#8220;The reason why I telegraphed you to come
back was because you haven&#8217;t kept your promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which one?&#8221; he inquired, with large indulgence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The one you made me when you were sending
David out here. You promised me that he
wasn&#8217;t to be spoiled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s it, is it?&#8221;&mdash;with another of the
deep-chested chuckles. &#8220;All right; let&#8217;s have it:
what do you think you&#8217;ve found out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, well enough,&#8221; she returned coldly.
&#8220;For a time, I think, Mr. Plegg was able to keep
the crooked things hidden from David&mdash;as you
doubtless instructed him to. But of course David
soon found out what is being done, and that it is
being done by your orders. And now you are
about to make a criminal of him. I don&#8217;t see how
you can ever look his father in the face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eben Grillage wagged his big head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all I&#8217;ve got in the world, Vinnie, girl,
and there&#8217;s mighty little I wouldn&#8217;t do for you;
but it&#8217;s terribly hard to live up to your notions,
sometimes. You&#8217;ve been a business man&#8217;s daughter
all your life, and yet you haven&#8217;t the faintest
idea of what business means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a very clear idea of what it means to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
cheat, to lie, to put human life in jeopardy, and
to take a clean, straightforward young man like
David Vallory and turn him into a potential murderer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw!&#8221; grunted the king of the contractors.
&#8220;I suppose somebody has been scaring you
about that tunnel and the few cracks it has in the
roof. Was it David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t David; I found out about it
myself, before you went away. And the &#8216;few
cracks&#8217; have nearly killed one man, already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strayer, you mean?&mdash;I had David&#8217;s report of
that. Strayer is a pretty good engineer, and he
ought to have known better than to pry a rock
loose and let it fall on his own head. Vinnie, I&#8217;m
getting sore about this thing. That tunnel roof
will stand up all right if they&#8217;ll only quit monkeying
with it and let it alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not here to argue with you about the tunnel
as a tunnel,&#8221; said the daughter, with a touch
of the true Grillage bluntness. &#8220;I merely wish to
find out if you&#8217;re going to try to patch up that
broken promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the name of common sense can I do&mdash;more
than I have done? I wrote Plegg to keep
David on the windward side of the little economies
we have to make, and I&#8217;m sorry if he hasn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
been able to do it. I&#8217;ll haul Plegg over the coals,
if that will make you feel any better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Plegg doubtless did his best, and it wasn&#8217;t
good enough. David is a graduate engineer and
a grown man. He would be singularly stupid if
he could be your chief of construction and not
know what was going on right under his eyes.
But that is not the point now. Are you, or are
you not, going to give David authority to do what
he, and Mr. Plegg, and every member of your
own engineering staff, know ought to be done to
that dangerous place in the tunnel&mdash;a thing that
is endangering the lives of the men every day?
That is what I came to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a rare thing for Eben Grillage to refuse
his daughter&#8217;s demands, even when they were unreasonable;
but the habits of a ruthless life-time
were too strong to be set aside, even at the bidding
of indulgent fatherly affection.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are my daughter, Vinnie, but you are just
like other women when you get your head set on
anything. If I should let you run my business
for me, there wouldn&#8217;t be any business left after
a little while, and we&#8217;d both join the bread line.
If you&#8217;ve made up your mind that David is the
man you want, just say so and I&#8217;ll take him off
the job and set him up in any kind of business you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
pick out&mdash;if you can pick one that measures up
to your Utopian notions of honesty. That&#8217;s fair,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer the question. There was
one more arrow in her quiver and she fitted it to
the string and drew the bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;The tunnel isn&#8217;t the only thing, as you know.
James Lushing makes it an open boast that he
will break you, and you know best what reasons
he may have for thinking such a thing possible.
Beyond that, David has met him and they have
quarreled&mdash;fought. I have been told that Lushing&#8217;s
first blow will be struck at David, to get him
out of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you any such thing as that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter; I have heard it, and I have no
reason to doubt the truth of the report. David
is so loyal to you that he is the biggest obstacle in
Lushing&#8217;s way. Everybody knows that Lushing
can command the help of any number of desperate
characters in Powder Can. It wouldn&#8217;t be beyond
him to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;To have David killed off out of the way?&#8221;
supplied the big man, with another chuckle. &#8220;If
you go much deeper, you&#8217;ll be telling me that
David is the man, after all. But don&#8217;t you worry.
When you marry David Vallory, Vinnie, you&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
marry a man. If he is half the scrapper I take
him to be, he&#8217;ll be well able to take care of himself
in any mix-up with Jim Lushing&mdash;or with any
of Lushing&#8217;s paid blacklegs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The special pleader&#8217;s eyes grew suddenly weary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you will do nothing about the tunnel?&#8221;
she asked patiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not until I have some better reason than a
foolish little girl&#8217;s notion&mdash;no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t David told you what he thinks ought
to be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, of course; the hard-rock men got him
rattled, right at the start, and he came to me about
it, boy-like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you told him to let it alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I did. We are going to lose money
enough on this job, as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fine persistence was broken at last. The
daughter of the luxuries&mdash;and the ideals&mdash;rose
and moved toward the door. As she reached
the vestibule exit she turned and gazed at the big
man filling the great arm-chair, and there was
neither anger nor impatience in her eyes; only a
profound depth of shocked disappointment and
reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never knew you <i>could</i> be so hard and pitiless,&#8221;
she said slowly. &#8220;If this is what money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
and the love of it can do to you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The swing
door of the vestibule yielded under her hand and
she went out, leaving the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>At the car-steps the negro porter had placed
his carpeted foot-stool, but Silas Plegg was not
there to see the president&#8217;s daughter safely across
the tracks. It is conceivable that she did not
mark the omission. From childhood she had
known construction yards and the paraphernalia
of the contracting trade, and her father was fond
of boasting that she was as self-reliant as any
boy.</p>

<p>Picking her way in the gathering dusk around
the obstructing cars filled with building material,
she came presently to the foot of the path leading
up to the Inn. Out of the first clump of scrub
pine on the hill trail a woman darted into the path
and blocked it. Virginia Grillage stopped short
with a little gasp of apprehension. Then she saw
who it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;Judith? were you looking for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was. They couldn&#8217;t tell me at the hotel,
and I was that frightened I thought I&#8217;d be choking.
Jack Dargin sent me, and the other Jack&mdash;Black
Jack Runnels, he is&mdash;would be killing me
if he knew I came. You&#8217;ll remember what I was
telling you yesterday. David is to be murdered&mdash;in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
the tunnel some way&mdash;I don&#8217;t know how.
They&#8217;re to get him in between the shifts; when
the day men have come out and before the night
men have gone in. Dargin says there&#8217;d be a clock
of some kind in a box&mdash;he said to tell you that,
and you&#8217;d understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But David isn&#8217;t at the tunnel; he is at one of
the lower camps. Mr. Plegg told me so just a
few minutes ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he was, but he isn&#8217;t now; he went up
on an engine not ten minutes ago. It was Simmy
Backus&#8217;s job to get him there&mdash;to &#8217;phone him
there was a man hurt in the tunnel. He&#8217;d fall for
that&mdash;David would&mdash;and he went. I saw the engine
when it passed me, going up. What must we
do? &#8217;Tis you that would be loving David, Vinnie
Grillage, and that I know well, but you&#8217;re not the
only one: I&mdash;I&#8217;d die for him this minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Virginia Grillage, quick-witted
and resourceful as any daughter of Eve since the
world began, stood shocked and irresolute, fighting
desperately for some shreddings of the capability
to act which had suddenly deserted her.
Then the lost self-control came back with a bound.</p>

<p>&#8220;The telephone!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;You run back
to the hotel, Judith, and find Bert Oswald&mdash;tell
him what you&#8217;ve told me and he&#8217;ll know what to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
do! While you&#8217;re doing that, I&#8217;ll try to find a
&#8217;phone here in the yards. Run!&#8221; and she set the
example by flying down the path and dodging
around the obstructing cars to reach the <i>Athenia</i>.</p>

<p>To her utter dismay, she found the private car
untenanted. The lights were still on, and the
recently opened mail lay on the desk, but the big
swing-chair was empty. Twice, and again, she
called her father, and when there was no answer
she caught up the telephone set from the desk and
tried to make somebody hear. But the set was
dead; the wires connecting it with the working
system had not been restrung since the <i>Athenia</i>
had returned from Red Butte.</p>

<p>Next she made frantic and fruitless search for
the porter; but the negro, too, had disappeared.
Plegg was the alternative now, and she ran
breathlessly up the yard to the office bunk car.
But this, also, proved to be a hope defeated, or
at least deferred. The car was dark when she
reached it, and when she tried the door she found
it locked. The remaining expedient, the only one
that suggested itself, was to run to the Inn railroad
station a half-mile distant down the yard,
where she knew there was an accessible telephone.
It was a lame expedient and she knew it; a thousand
things might delay the sending of the message<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
of warning to the tunnel, and time was priceless.
Yet she ran, stumbling over the loosely
bedded cross-ties, and praying that she might happen
upon Plegg or some other member of the
staff who would know what to do and how to
do it.</p>

<p>She had scarcely begun this new flight when
she saw one of the construction locomotives lumbering
toward her on the main track. The quick
wit was coming to its own again, and she stopped,
stripping off her coat and stepping into the cone
of the headlight beam so that she could be seen
when she waved her signal. The engine was Callahan&#8217;s
&#8220;mogul,&#8221; and she gave a little sob of joy
when she recognized the good-natured Irishman
who leaned from his cab window to ask what she
wanted. Callahan was the driver with whom
she had ridden oftenest when David Vallory had
been showing her over the job.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you and your engine, Mr. Callahan!&#8221;
she panted. &#8220;Will you take orders from me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I will, Miss Vinnie,&#8221; was the quick response;
and when the fireman had helped her up
to the foot-board: &#8220;Where will ye be wanting the
ould &#8217;Thirty-six to be taking you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the tunnel&mdash;as fast as ever you can go!
It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s life and death!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>Callahan asked no further questions. Miss
Virginia was the big boss&#8217;s daughter, and her demands
were sufficient law and Gospel for any man
on the Grillage Company&#8217;s pay-rolls. While the
fireman was lifting her to his box, the heavy construction
machine went slamming out over the
yard switches, shrieking its warning to all and
sundry, and the race was begun.</p>

<p>Though the track was new and rough, and the
detours around the hill cuttings held curves of
hazard, Callahan&mdash;&#8220;Wild Irish,&#8221; they called him
on the job&mdash;slackened speed for nothing. Onward
and upward through the gathering darkness
roared the big locomotive, vomiting a trail of
sparks to mark its crooked climb. Virginia Grillage
tried pitifully hard to plan what she should
do when the goal should be reached; but the dominant
impulse would have nothing to do with cool-headed
plannings. David&#8217;s life hung in the balance,
and David must be warned. She could get
no further than this.</p>

<p>So it came about that when the tunnel portal
was reached, and Callahan and his firemen were
helping her down from the high cab, common
sense and clarity of mind fled away, and she was
once more only an incoherent and badly frightened
young woman. A gang of workmen waited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
at the tunnel mouth; dimly she realized that this
was the night shift, preparing to go in when the
day men should come out. One glance showed
her that there was no member of the engineering
staff with them; no one in authority save the burly
Cornish drill-boss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Vallory!&#8221; she demanded; &#8220;where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Cornishman knew the president&#8217;s daughter
by sight. He pointed into the dark depths of
the tunnel. &#8220;If ye&#8217;ll wait just a minute; it&#8217;s time
for the shift to be coomin&#8217; out, and he&#8217;ll be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
but the remainder of the sentence was lost upon
the young woman who had darted into the black
depths with neither light nor guide, stumbling
blindly over the cross-ties of the spoil-track in her
flight, and following the lead of the wide-spaced
line of electric bulbs into the grim heart of the
mountain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A scant margin of two minutes after his daughter
had halted and boarded a construction engine
to be whirled away to the tunnel, Eben Grillage,
who had been across to the commissary to put
in a call for Plegg, returned to his desk in the
<i>Athenia</i> and once more began the reading of his
neglected mail. A matter of three-quarters of an
hour later, while he was still immersed in his correspondence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
the swing-door of the forward corridor
flew open as from the impact of a heavy projectile
and Silas Plegg staggered into the office
compartment. His lips were drawn back and
he was shaking like one in an ague fit.</p>

<p>&#8220;The roof in Heading Number One!&#8221; he
jerked out. &#8220;It&#8217;s down, damn you, do you hear
that?&mdash;it&#8217;s down, and the day shift is behind it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Eben Grillage&#8217;s heavy face went purple, and
for an instant his jaw sagged and he gasped for
breath. Then the strong will triumphed for the
moment over the failing body and he sprang out
of his chair to catch the news-bringer in a grasp
that threatened to crush muscle and bone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vallory&mdash;where&#8217;s David Vallory?&#8221; he
stormed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s&mdash;he&#8217;s in there with the men&mdash;and&mdash;and
that isn&#8217;t all: your daughter&#8217;s there, too&mdash;if she
isn&#8217;t buried under the slide!&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly the big man&#8217;s grasp upon Plegg relaxed
and the veins in his forehead swelled to whip-cords.
Eben Grillage&#8217;s day of reckoning had
come. Before the first assistant realized what
was happening, the gigantic figure of the contractor-king
swayed like a toppling tower and would
have fallen with a crash if Plegg had not braced
himself and caught it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVI<br />


The Heart of Qojogo</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">VIRGINIA GRILLAGE, flying into the tunnel
depths over the rock-strewn spoil-track,
was mercifully spared the introductory horrors of
the sudden entombment. An earthquake crash,
so close behind her that she was enveloped in a
shower of flakings and spallings and stifling dust,
a rush of air that was like a tornado to sweep
her from her feet, and she stumbled and fell
and was blotted out.</p>

<p>When she recovered consciousness there was
darkness that could be felt and a silence to match
it. She was lying on a pallet of coats; she knew
they were coats because the sleeves of one of them
were drawn over her; and some one was chafing
her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it you, David?&#8221; she asked in a voice made
small and weak by the horrible stillness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; can you tell me how badly you are hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>She grasped his arm and sat up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>&#8220;I&mdash;I think I&#8217;m not hurt at all,&#8221; she stammered.
Then: &#8220;Did the roof come down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It did. We found you half buried in the
muck. What under heaven were you doing in
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to tell you,&#8221; she said simply.
&#8220;Where are the men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all down at the slide, and Regnier
is with them. They are trying to find out how
effectually we are buried. You are sure you&#8217;re
not hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little bruised and shaken up, of course, but
that is nothing. Will the men be able to dig us
out?&#8221;</p>

<p>With any other woman he knew as the questioner,
David Vallory might have temporized.
But he knew Virginia Grillage&#8217;s quality and the
steel-true fineness of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not be able to dig out from this
side,&#8221; he said soberly. &#8220;We are not equipped
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shuddered.</p>

<p>&#8220;This darkness is very horrible, isn&#8217;t it? And
the air&mdash;it seems so close.&#8221;</p>

<p>David did not tell her that there was the best of
reasons for the closeness of the air; that the ventilating
conduit, and the smaller pipe-line which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
supplied the air pressure for the drills, were
crushed under the avalanche, leaving them in a
sealed pocket in the heart of Qojogo.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t let it grip you too hard,&#8221; he said,
meaning to hearten her if he could. &#8220;By this time
every camp on the line will have heard the news,
and there will be no lack of help.&#8221;</p>

<p>She groped in the darkness and found his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not afraid, David&mdash;this is no time to be
afraid. So you needn&#8217;t blink the facts for me.
How wide was the bad place in the roof?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty feet or more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say there are plenty of men to help; but
you know, and I know, that only a few of them
can work at one time in such a narrow place as the
tunnel. Tell me plainly: will there be air enough
to last until we starve to death? Or shall we be
stifled before we have had time to starve?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not admitting either contingency yet; and
you mustn&#8217;t. While there is life, there is always
hope. But I can&#8217;t understand why you came here.
What made you think I needed to be told?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That much is easily explained,&#8221; she said
calmly. &#8220;There was a plot to murder you, and at
the same time to bring about the first of a series
of disasters that would smash the Grillage Company.
Did you get a telephone message that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
man was hurt, and that you were wanted up
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did. I was at McCulloch&#8217;s camp and I took
an engine and came up here in a hurry. The accident
report was a fake, and I came in to ask
Regnier what he knew about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a part of the plot,&#8221; she went on evenly.
&#8220;It was Judith Fallon who came and told me. She
had already warned me that there was something
threatening, but she did not know what it was.
That first time was just before Mr. Strayer was
hurt, and all she could tell me then was that James
Lushing &#8216;had it in for you,&#8217; as she put it, and was
plotting with a man named Black Jack Runnels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Runnels?&#8221; he queried. &#8220;Not Dargin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it was Runnels; I&#8217;m sure of the name.
Yesterday she came again. She had heard a
little more, but nothing very definite. Then this
evening I had been down to the <i>Athenia</i>&mdash;it came
in from Red Butte on the afternoon train, as perhaps
you know&mdash;and I was on my way back to the
Inn. Judith met me on the path; she had been up
to the hotel, looking for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he encouraged.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was terribly excited and said that the
thing, whatever it was, was to be done this evening,
at the changing hour of the shifts. She told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
me that a man named Backus was to call you by
&#8217;phone and tell you that there was a man hurt in
the tunnel. Then she said that you had already
gone up the line; she saw you on an engine that
overtook and passed her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a woman running on the Powder Can
road, but I didn&#8217;t recognize her as Judith,&#8221; said
David.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t, of course, with the engine running
fast. When she told me that you were already
on your way up here, I didn&#8217;t know what to
do. Then I thought of the telephones, and sent
her up to the hotel to find Herbert Oswald and
ask him to call you at the tunnel &#8217;phone, while I
ran down to the <i>Athenia</i> to get father to &#8217;phone.
There was nobody in the <i>Athenia</i>; father had
gone out somewhere. Then I tried to find Mr.
Plegg, but he was gone, too. I didn&#8217;t know where
to look for another telephone nearer than the Inn
railroad station, and I was starting to run down
there when I saw Callahan on his engine and made
him bring me up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely you saw the night shift getting
ready to come in, didn&#8217;t you? Do you mean to
tell me that that bunch of thick-headed stone-borers
let you come in here alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were not to blame&mdash;not at all. I merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
asked if you were in here, and when one of them
said you were, I ran.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am too thankful to say what I ought to say,
about them and about you&mdash;thankful that you are
alive,&#8221; said David, and his voice trembled a little.
&#8220;One second, a half-second, later and you would
have been fairly under the slide. As it was, we
had to dig you out; and&mdash;and Vinnie, I hope no
human being will ever suffer as I did when we
found you. I&mdash;I thought you were dead, and that
I had killed you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t have been you,&#8221; she said softly;
&#8220;it would have been the thing we call Business;
the thing that is killing all the kindliness, all the
fairness, all the best there is in us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he denied sturdily, &#8220;I can&#8217;t let you shift
the blame that way. I knew what ought to be
done here; I have known it all along. If I had
made a fight for it with your father, as I should
have done, he would have given in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said wearily. &#8220;That was
what I went down to the <i>Athenia</i> for this evening&mdash;before
I met Judith. Father wouldn&#8217;t listen to
me; and now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>David knew what it was she had begun to say
and could not finish; that now Eben Grillage had
lost the daughter for whom, at the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
ends, all the cost-cuttings and life-risking economies
had been made. Hence, he tried again to
comfort her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must always give him the benefit of the
doubt,&#8221; he interposed. &#8220;From what Judith told
you, it is perfectly plain that the roof hasn&#8217;t fallen
of its own accord at this particular time, though
there isn&#8217;t much doubt but that it would have come
down some time. Within the past few days a
crack had opened in one side of it big enough to
conceal a charge of dynamite&mdash;or a time-clock
infernal machine, which was probably what was
used. It was timed to go off between the shifts,
and Regnier and I were the only ones they meant
to catch. It was the natural inference that we
would stay in the heading to see the night shift
come on; Regnier always does that.&#8221;</p>

<p>As if the mention of his name had evoked him,
the fiery little French-Canadian came up to the
heading with a flickering candle-end shielded between
his hands. His first inquiry was for the
president&#8217;s daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mees Virginia&mdash;you vill not been keel? Zat
ees <i>tres bon</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you find out, Jean?&#8221; David demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eet ees bad&mdash;ver&#8217; bad. They vill deeg on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
the other side&mdash;peek&mdash;peek&mdash;but zat loose stuff
she ees come down so fast as they peek it out, <i>oui</i>.
Eet ees come down on our side, <i>aussi</i>, like one
damn&#8217; hopper&mdash;pardon, M&#8217;am&#8217;selle&mdash;like one
hopper full with loose stones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no tools on this side?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nossing moch. The men s&#8217;all deeg with zat
what they &#8217;ave; the peek and shovel of the
mucker; but eet ees nossing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since anything was better than stagnation, Virginia
proposed that they go to the slide to look on,
or to help, if they could. The pilgrimage was
made in silence, Regnier lighting the way as best
he could with his candle-end. The barrier, as the
candles revealed it, was a blank slope of broken
rock. Four or five men of the day shift were
shoveling half-heartedly at it, and the futility of
the effort was apparent at once. For every shovelful
removed, two more rolled down from the filled
&#8220;hopper&#8221; above. David Vallory called a halt at
once on the discouraging attempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it alone, men; it isn&#8217;t worth while,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You are only wasting your strength, and
you may need it all before we get out of here.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the small confusion of the shoveling
stopped they all fell to listening. Far away, so
far that it sounded like miles instead of feet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
inches, they could hear faint tappings, followed at
irregular intervals by the hoarse rumble of falling
detritus. David went on his knees at one side of
the pit to examine the pipe of the air-line. It was
bent and crushed out of shape, and there was no
air coming through it, though a subdued hissing
proved that the pressure was on, and that the engineer
at the portal compressor-plant was still trying
to force air into the blocked heading.</p>

<p>While he was kneeling at the pipe, David discovered
another ominous threat; his knees were
wet, and in the drainage ditch cut at the side of the
tunnel a little pool was forming. He knew well
what this meant; that death in still another form
was creeping upon them. The tunnel had been a
&#8220;wet&#8221; tunnel almost from the beginning, and here
was a hint that the great slide might possibly
prove to be a dam as well as a barrier. Fortunately,
however, there was a slight up-grade in the
bore, and it might be hours, or even days, before
the highest point, at the working end of the bore,
would overflow.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not doing any good here,&#8221; he said to
the young woman who stood listening with him.
&#8220;We may as well go back where it is drier.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men had scattered as far as the limits of
the cavern would permit, and Regnier surrendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
his bit of candle to David to light the retreat. In
the heading David made a platform of a few of
the bulkhead planks and rearranged the coat-cushioned
pallet.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a little while the close air will make you
sleepy,&#8221; he told his fellow-prisoner. &#8220;When it
does, you must get all the rest you can. I am
afraid we are in for a long siege.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded and sat down on the plank pallet,
locking her hands over her knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be afraid to say what you think&mdash;to
me, David. In your own mind you are wondering
which will come first: hunger, the bad air, the
rising water, or the digging away of the slide. I
can face what is in store for us as well as another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t question your courage; God knows,
you proved it sufficiently by coming in here when
you knew what was going to happen&mdash;for you
practically did know,&#8221; he hastened to say. Then:
&#8220;Some of us men will probably break long before
you will. That is why I say you must rest while
you can. You may be needed later on&mdash;to keep
some of us from forgetting that we <i>are</i> men.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him a tired little smile. &#8220;You are giving
me a name to live up to. I wonder if I shall
be able to do it&mdash;at the last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it for a single moment; I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
never doubted it. Did you have dinner before you
began on this hideous adventure?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded again. &#8220;It was a good dinner, too.
Your father and mine were at the table, and
Lucille and Herbert Oswald.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Wishart and the Englishman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; they respected the family reunion. Your
father looked years younger, and he is as brown
as anything. And that reminds me; there is something
I ought to tell you&mdash;before a time comes
when I may not care to talk, or you to listen. It is
about Lucille and Herbert.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave Herbert his hint&mdash;after you had given
me leave to do as I pleased. That same evening,
when I was in my bed-room lying down, Herbert
came up to find Lucille. They sat together in the
sitting-room of our suite, and, most naturally, they
thought I had gone out. It was wicked of me to
lie there and listen, but I hadn&#8217;t the heart to let
them know that they were not alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody knows about your heart,&#8221; David
put in, striving to dispel a little of the gloom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herbert said his little say very gently and tenderly,
and oh, David, I wish you could have seen
Lucille&#8217;s face! It was just like a beautiful rose
blossoming while you looked. She didn&#8217;t say anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
at first; she just put her hand up to Herbert&#8217;s
face, and I could see her touching his forehead
and eyes and lips with those finger-tips of hers
that can see more than most of us can with our
eyes. &#8216;I&mdash;I wanted to see if you really meant it,
Herbert, or if you were only just sorry for me,&#8217;
she said, so softly that it was hardly more than a
whisper; and then: &#8216;Oh, my dear, my dear&mdash;I am
<i>so</i> happy!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence for a little time; then David
said: &#8220;I am glad you have told me, Vinnie; it&#8217;s a
tremendous comfort to me now, in the light of
what may happen to us here. You see, I am taking
you at your word and not trying to hide things
from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you think it is doubtful&mdash;our getting out
alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very doubtful,&#8221; he admitted, lowering his
voice so that the men might not hear. &#8220;If it were
a mere matter of digging out what has already
fallen in&mdash;but it isn&#8217;t, you know. The crevice has
been &#8216;prospected&#8217; with test holes all the way up to
the surface on the mountain-side three hundred
feet above us. Plegg told me that only yesterday.
It is rotten all the way through, and it will probably
fall in as fast as it can be dug out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was an interval of speechlessness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
and then the hushed voice of the young woman
sitting with her hands locked over her knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did my father know of that prospecting?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor father!&#8221; she said, and her voice was
shaken. &#8220;He is just simply stone blind on that
side, David. I&#8217;ve tried and tried, and I can&#8217;t
make him see! And now&mdash;he is going&mdash;to pay&mdash;the
highest price he knows&mdash;for the dreadful
cure!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is time for you to forget for a while, if you
can,&#8221; said David, not knowing what else to say;
and he went aside with Regnier, blowing out the
light of the precious candle-end to save it for a
time of greater need.</p>

<p>A little later, when he came back and struck a
match, he found her sleeping with her face hidden
in the crook of an arm, and he was glad.</p>

The Terror</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Virginia opened her eyes, after a
troubled sleep which seemed to her to
have lasted only a few moments, it was with a
start, and out of the depths of a nightmare in
which she had dreamed that some one was smothering
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>David!</i>&#8221; she called softly; and he answered at
once out of the enveloping darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here&mdash;sitting beside you. Have you had
a good sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was dreadful!&#8221; she shuddered. &#8220;I dreamed
that a big man like&mdash;like my father&mdash;had his hand
over my face and was stifling me. What time
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is another day. It was a little past eight
o&#8217;clock when I struck a match about an hour ago.
You have slept all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; she inquired quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sleep very much&mdash;naturally. Besides,
I didn&#8217;t wish to. I was afraid you might
waken and call me, and I shouldn&#8217;t hear.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>&#8220;There is no news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little. Regnier reports that the digging has
gone on steadily all night. He knows the Morse
alphabet, and he contrived to get into communication
with Plegg during the night by tapping on the
crushed air-pipe; so they know on the outside that
we are here and alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pressed her hands to her forehead.
Though he could not see the movement, he knew
she made it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does your head ache?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some. The air is much worse, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t any better,&#8221; he conceded. &#8220;Once, in
the night, they tried shooting the slide from the
other side&mdash;blasting it with dynamite, you know.
That was what made Regnier try the pipe-tapping.
The fumes of the dynamite were blown through
the loose stuff and that made it worse for us. Now
they are trying to force a large pipe through the
mass of the slide to give us air and food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will they succeed?&#8221; she queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I promised, last night, to talk straight to you.
If the slide is made up entirely of broken rock in
small pieces, as it seems to be from our side, it
should be comparatively easy to drive through it.
But if the mass happens to contain large bowlders&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>&#8220;Then they will drill and blast them,&#8221; she put
in quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but it may prove to be a long job; and I
must be plain again. Every move they make
seems to bring down more of the stuff from above.
The water is not rising much, but the air is growing
worse every hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All of which means that you think we should
be prepared for the worst?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; always continuing to hope for the best, of
course. Are you very hungry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. But you must be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can stand it better than the workmen. They
have had nothing since they came in yesterday at
ten o&#8217;clock. Very few of them carry a dinner
bucket on an eight-hour shift.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are they enduring it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Each after his kind. Three of the Welshmen
wanted to sing a while ago, but I wouldn&#8217;t let
them. I knew it would waken you, and I thought
you ought to sleep as long as you could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go right away and tell them to sing all they
wish to!&#8221; she commanded instantly; and a little
time after he had gone and returned, a Welsh
melody rose on the stagnant air, lifted by voices
that were strangely deadened by the stifling closeness
of the dank cavern.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>This was the beginning of a day of creeping
horrors. Steadily, hour by hour, the vitiated air
grew worse. All day long the rescuers were apparently
fighting madly with the difficulties encountered
in the pipe-driving attempt, but the buried
ones could form no estimate of the progress made,
or, indeed, if there were any progress at all.</p>

<p>As the hours wore on, the imprisoned workmen
began to react to the torturings of the foul air and
the despairing situation, each after his kind, as
David had said. One man, a huge-muscled Cornish
miner, went stark mad and it took the united
strength of all the others to conquer and tie him.
Another, a north-of-England coal miner, by his
burring speech, was the next to break; he was not
violent, but he babbled incessantly of green fields
and sunshine&mdash;of running brooks, and the fresh,
keen air of the north.</p>

<p>David Vallory tried to shield the woman he
loved from as much of this as he could, and
Regnier seconded him loyally. But at the last the
heroic heart refused to be sheltered longer and
kept away from the abyss into which the men were
slipping one by one.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; you must let me do what I can, while I
can!&#8221; she cried; and then she went about among
the men and talked to them, bidding them be of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
good cheer, and telling them that they must be men
to the very end&mdash;that God was good and merciful
and He would not let them suffer more than they
could bear. And once she persuaded the Welshmen
to sing a hymn with her, her woman&#8217;s voice
rising clear above the deeper tones of the men,
and never faltering even on the last heart-moving
stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes;</div>
<div class="verse">Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies;</div>
<div class="verse">Heaven&#8217;s morning breaks and earth&#8217;s vain shadows flee;</div>
<div class="verse">In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>It was then that Patrick Connolly, drill foreman
and the leader in many a brutal pay-day brawl,
made husky confession.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis your father&#8217;s blame, this, and well do we
know it,&#8221; he grated. &#8220;&#8217;Twas in the back of me
mind all night and all day that if we ever got out
o&#8217; this I&#8217;d take me two hands and choke him to
hell, as we&#8217;re chokin&#8217; this minut&#8217;. But &#8217;tis all past
and gone now, what wid the blessed love an&#8217; nerve
of you, little gyerl; an&#8217; here&#8217;s hopin&#8217; that the
Gawd you believe in &#8217;ll let you die quiet-like an&#8217;
peaceable, as I&#8217;d want my own little gyerl to go if
I had wan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through all this, David Vallory lived as one in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
hideous dream. But when the flare of another
of the precious matches, a tiny flame that was
scarcely visible in its brief and futile struggle with
the heavy air, showed him that a second night was
far advanced, he drew Virginia away to the heading
and made her lie down on the coat-covered
pallet, which he had remade, propping it as high
as he could on the broken stone to escape the
lower stratum of air.</p>

<p>For a long time she was silent, and when she
spoke it was to ask if he were still beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Vinnie; I am here&mdash;and I shall be here
when they find us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think it is all over, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that in a few more hours, a very few,
the end must come. We can&#8217;t go on breathing
this air indefinitely.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat up again at that, and again he knew that
she was holding her head in her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever wondered how the end would
come to you, David?&mdash;how you would feel, and
what you would do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not as often as I ought perhaps. There was
a time last year, when I was in a caisson with Shubrick
at Coulee du Sac. The bottom blew out
under the air pressure, and we all thought we were
gone. I don&#8217;t remember much about what I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
thought&mdash;only that Shubrick and I owed it to the
&#8216;sand-hogs&#8217; to get them into the air-lock first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once I saw a woman die,&#8221; she said, her voice
thrilling with suppressed emotion. &#8220;She was horribly
frightened at the last, and&mdash;and I&#8217;ve always
prayed since then that when my time should come
I might not go that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t,&#8221; he made himself say; &#8220;there isn&#8217;t
a drop of craven blood in you, Vinnie&mdash;dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the brooding silence fell, and, as before,
it was the young woman who broke it.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we are going to be stifled in a little while&mdash;as
I suppose we are&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t matter much what
we say to each other, does it, David? I mean that
we needn&#8217;t consider any future, so far as we usually
count futures in a conventional way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; we are only a man and a woman, naked
before the God who created us, Vinnie&mdash;and we
are about to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;David, dear&mdash;<i>I love you!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; he returned gently; &#8220;I have known
it for a night and a day,&#8221; and he took her in his
arms and kissed her almost solemnly. &#8220;You are
giving your life because you tried to save mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no effort to free herself. She was
weary and weak to the point of collapse, and the
supporting arms were grateful and comforting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>&#8220;I had ambitions,&#8221; she murmured; &#8220;such splendid
ambitions! Ever since I have been old enough
to understand, I have known how dis&mdash;dishonestly
much of the money was made in the contracting,
and it has hurt me&mdash;oh, you don&#8217;t know how it has
hurt me! Father doesn&#8217;t see; he simply can&#8217;t see.
And then my ambition came. A year ago I saw
how father felt toward you; first because you were
Adam Vallory&#8217;s son, and afterward because you
were yourself&mdash;just such a son as he would have
given worlds to have for his own. I whispered to
myself then that I would make you love me and
marry me; and then there would be two of us to
fight for honesty and fair-dealing and the&mdash;the
righteousness that cares for something more than
merely keeping clear of the law. You would have
helped me, wouldn&#8217;t you, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent and kissed the pulse in the throbbing
temple.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could have made of me anything that you
wished, dear. You know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t wish to make anything of you but what
you were; what you had always been until father
tied you hand and foot with that horrible debt of
gratitude. Then he sent you out here, and I knew
what would happen&mdash;what simply <i>must</i> happen;
how your gratitude to him would break you down,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
first in the little things, and then in the terrible
ones. And that was why I persuaded him to
come, and to bring me. Was it all very&mdash;unwomanly,
David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the finest thing a woman ever did for
the man she loved. But you have always done the
fine things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even when I made you fall in love with me
when you didn&#8217;t want to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I outdistanced you by many miles in that,&#8221; he
said with sober gravity. &#8220;I think it went back to
the kiddie days in old Middleboro.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In spite of Judith?&#8221;</p>

<p>He held her closer. &#8220;That is the one thing that
I have to confess, Vinnie. I did go about a good
bit with Judith, in my college years and before.
We were just good chums, and I never thought for
a moment&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you didn&#8217;t! But I don&#8217;t blame Judith,
either; I can&#8217;t, when I&#8217;ve done the same thing
myself. But you were saying it went back to the
kiddie days with&mdash;with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but I didn&#8217;t realize it until we met in
Florida. I was full of hope then: I meant to
make a success of myself so that I might go to
your father like a man and say, &#8216;I want to marry
your daughter.&#8217; Then the big debt fell on me, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
I couldn&#8217;t say anything while I owed your father
more than I could ever hope to repay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t died&mdash;we are both just the same
as dead, aren&#8217;t we?&mdash;if you hadn&#8217;t died, you were
going to pay him in the best possible way; by making
&#8216;the apple of his eye&#8217; deliriously happy, and by
showing him the honest way out of all the little
crookednesses and the big ones, too. Oh, yes;
that was what was going to happen. After we
were married he would have taken you into the
company, and in just a little while you and I together
would have been setting the pace; the good
old-fashioned, honest pace. Isn&#8217;t it the pity of all
pities that we had to go and die and spoil it all?&mdash;that
we couldn&#8217;t have lived to make it come
true, David, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; he said under his breath, but for other
reply there were no words.</p>

<p>After a time she spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I think I&#8217;m going now, David. You said
I&#8217;d outlast you and the men, but I shouldn&#8217;t want
that. No, dear; there isn&#8217;t any pain, except in my
head. I&#8217;m just&mdash;tired&mdash;and&mdash;sleepy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t give up, Vinnie!&#8221; he pleaded passionately.
&#8220;We must live&mdash;both of us&mdash;to make
it all come true! Listen! Isn&#8217;t that the men trying
to cheer? <i>O my God, I thank thee!</i>&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>A roaring blast of clean, fresh air, driven
strongly enough to penetrate even to their distant
retreat at the heading, fanned their faces. &#8220;The
pipe!&#8221; he shouted; &#8220;they&#8217;ve got the pipe through
and they&#8217;ve turned the air on. Vinnie&mdash;<i>Vinnie!</i>&mdash;we
shall live, and it <i>shall</i> come true!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the sudden reversal from despair to hope
had been too much for the strong heart. The
yielding body David was clasping in his arms had
become limp and unresponsive, and the lips were
silent.</p>

Regeneration</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE pipe of life, a four-inch steel tube which
had been driven by screw-jack pressure
through the mass of the slide as a result of Plegg&#8217;s
inventive strugglings, soon refreshed the vitiated
air in the sealed cavern. Beyond this, food, in
well-wrapped paper cartridges, and hot coffee, in
bottles, were passed through the tube, and the
famished prisoners were able to break their long
fast. That nothing within the possibilities should
be lacking, Plegg ran electric wires, with an incandescent
bulb attached, through the conduit, and
thus the feast was lighted.</p>

<p>In the fast-breaking, Regnier ate with his men,
but David carried his portion and Virginia&#8217;s a
little apart. Though she had revived quickly in
the splendid rebound of youth and health under
the changed conditions, the king&#8217;s daughter ate
sparingly and with eyes downcast, and was, in
David&#8217;s eyes, more radiantly beautiful than she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
had ever been. After the keen edge of famine&mdash;David&#8217;s
famine&mdash;was a little blunted, she looked
up and met his glances bravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t die, David, and&mdash;and you must forget,&#8221;
she pleaded. &#8220;You will forget, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget?&mdash;not if I live to be a million years
old,&#8221; he avowed gravely. And after a pause:
&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t be an Indian, Vinnie&mdash;to give, and
then want the gift returned. I am going to talk
to Plegg again in a few minutes, and you shall
hear what I say to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The previsioned talk with the first assistant&mdash;the
four-inch pipe serving for a speaking-tube&mdash;turned
out to be principally technical, to be sure.
In his proper person as chief engineer, David gave
directions for the pushing forward of the rescue
work. The jack-screw process was to be employed
again, this time to press a steel shield into
the mass of loose debris, so that the rescuers might
be protected as they dug. The shield could be
made out of a cast-off boiler shell with the heads
removed. In this manner a tunnel within the tunnel
could be excavated and the prisoners released.</p>

<p>With so much for the technicalities, the human
side of things came in for its word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Grillage with you?&#8221; David asked.</p>

<p>Plegg&#8217;s reply was guarded. He guessed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
guessed rightly, that Eben Grillage&#8217;s daughter was
listening with David at the prison end of the
speaking-tube.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Grillage is at the hotel; he is not very
well. He has had a stroke of some sort, but the
Brewster doctor who is with him says it isn&#8217;t necessarily
dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have sent him word that we are all alive
and well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure; that was the first thing we did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Now listen, and carry out my orders
to the letter. After you get the tunneling started
here, put Altman in charge and go yourself to the
telegraph office at the Inn station. I heard, day
before yesterday, that President Ford of the P.
S-W. was in Denver, with a number of his directors.
The report was that Mr. Ford and his
party were making an inspection trip over the
western lines of the system. You send a telegram
to Mr. Ford, asking him if he will come here for
a conference with me, bringing as many of the
directors as may be willing to come. Do you get
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly. What else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may sign my name to the telegram, and
make it as urgent as you can. This is important.
Then I want you to go up to the Inn and see Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
Grillage for yourself. Find out his condition exactly,
and come back here and report.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite. While you are at the hotel, see my
father and sister and Herbert Oswald, and tell
them that the danger is all over for us&mdash;that is,
if you haven&#8217;t already &#8217;phoned them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father and Oswald came up here with
me when the alarm was given, and they have been
here ever since until a couple of hours ago, when
I persuaded Oswald to take your father back to
the Inn on the assurance that we should reach you
with the pipe within a short time. Your father
was pretty well tuckered out, and I didn&#8217;t dare to
let him stay here any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good man!&#8221; said David; &#8220;I owe you something
for that, Silas. Be sure and tell them at the
hotel that we are all right and quite comfortable,
and that there is nothing to worry about. And
while you&#8217;re at it, you may give Oswald and my
sister my hearty congratulations, and tell them,
from Miss Virginia and me, that we hope they&#8217;ll
be as happy as they deserve to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plegg, the imperturbable, let slip a little imprecation
of joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ll be damned!&#8221; he burbled; &#8220;you don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
know what a relief it is to hear you talking that
way! Any more errands?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; one more. Our engagement&mdash;Miss Virginia&#8217;s
and mine&mdash;hasn&#8217;t been announced yet, so
you may break the news, if you care to; to Mr.
Grillage when you see him, to my people, and to
the folks at the Inn. Also, you may let it go to
the fellows on the staff and to the men on the job.
We shall be married as soon as Mr. Grillage is up
and able to give the bride away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&mdash;oh, <i>bully</i> good!&#8221; came from the other
end of the tube, from which it may be inferred
that the first assistant&#8217;s half-cynical habit of self-restraint
and reticence was broken beyond repair.
Then: &#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m taking your word for it,
but if Miss Virginia would&mdash;er&mdash;sort of counter-sign
the order ... I haven&#8217;t heard her voice
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia put her lips to the tube and her eyes
were dancing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so, Mr. Plegg; can you hear me? And
there are some other things that are going to be
so, too&mdash;things in which you&#8217;ll have to help. We
are counting upon you&mdash;may we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may, indeed; to the last scrapings of the
grab-bucket!&#8221; was the ready assurance. &#8220;Now&mdash;I
don&#8217;t want to be impolite, but if that is all, I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
ask you both to take your faces away from the
pipe; I&#8217;m going to put the air blast on again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even with the help of the steel shield it took the
remainder of the night and the better part of the
next forenoon for the outside men, working in fifteen-minute
shifts, to dig through the mass of the
slide, the work being delayed somewhat by the encountering,
in the midst of things, of a great bowlder
which had to be carefully blasted with dynamite.
Nevertheless, the task was accomplished
finally. With the advancing shield the diggers
burst through with a yell of triumph, and the poor
prisoners were passed out one by one to the clean
air and the blessed sunshine of the outdoor world.</p>

<p>Once more able to take command, David Vallory
gave directions for the clearing of the tunnel
by digging and timber-shoring from either side of
the slide, and outlined for Plegg in a few words a
plan for the excavating and permanent filling and
arching of the breach. Plegg heard him through,
and then looked up to say: &#8220;Does this mean that
we&#8217;re to have a new deal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Either a new deal or a smash. If I can come
to some sort of terms with Mr. Ford, we&#8217;ll go on
and finish this job honestly, the way it ought to be
finished. If I can&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll take our losses and get
out, without waiting to be kicked out.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>An engine had been &#8217;phoned for to come up
after the chief and Miss Grillage, but it was as
yet only on the way. Miss Virginia was talking to
the released hard-rock men, praising them for
their courage, and telling them how glad she was
to have been given the chance to share the peril
with them, since the peril had to be. This gave
Plegg his opportunity with his chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are speaking for Mr. Grillage, Vallory?&mdash;or
only for yourself?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I&#8217;m speaking for both of us. I&#8217;m
afraid Mr. Grillage is out of the active part of it,
permanently. Miss Virginia tells me that this is
his second stroke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Virginia,&#8221; said Plegg; &#8220;of course, she is
with you on this reformation turn-over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heart and soul; in fact, it is her idea. We&#8217;ll
fight it through together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the quaint smile twitched at the
corners of the first assistant&#8217;s thin-lipped mouth
and his eyes twinkled. &#8220;My congratulations,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m damned if you aren&#8217;t going to be
&#8216;too good,&#8217; after all! I hope you won&#8217;t fire your
first assistant crook, Vallory. I&#8217;d like to see how
it feels to work for an absolutely honest outfit for
just one time before I die. Do I stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as long as I do, Silas.&#8221; And then the engine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
came, and David and his charge were whirled
away to the valley.</p>

<p>At the stop at the foot of the Inn ridge, David
helped Virginia down from the engine cab, and
together they climbed the hill path. The news
had been passed to the tunnel that President Ford
and his inspecting committee had arrived at Powder
Gap an hour earlier and were quartered in the
Alta Vista; wherefore David Vallory knew that
his request had been granted and that his hour was
come.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will go to your father at once, of course,&#8221;
he said, as they were ascending the steps of the Inn
entrance. Then: &#8220;You must stand to your guns,
Vinnie, and do all the things you said you&#8217;d like
to do when you thought we had to die. Mr. Ford
is here, and after I&#8217;ve had a word with Dad and
sister, I&#8217;m going to fight the good fight with the
Short Line people, taking matters entirely into my
own hands. If Mr. Ford doesn&#8217;t fire us bodily,
this job shall be finished&mdash;and finished honestly.
After that, your father may fire me if he wishes
to; but he must be made to understand that if he
does, he is firing his daughter&#8217;s husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;it&#8217;s such a precious
thing to find that you are just as big and strong
as I always believed you were, David! I&#8217;ll stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
by, and after you are through with Mr. Ford, you
must come straight to our suite.&#8221; Then, with exaggerated
humility: &#8220;May I have your august permission
to say good-by to Freddy Wishart and
Cumberleigh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t&mdash;unless you do it by wire,&#8221; he
grinned. &#8220;Plegg tells me they went East on the
morning train, shortly after he had announced our
engagement here at the hotel. We can send them
cards a little later, if you wish.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIX<br />


As It Should Be</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE conference in the Alta Vista&#8217;s sun-parlor,
which was isolated for the purpose, was
rather long drawn out, as it was constrained to be,
but in due time the large-bodied, shrewd-eyed man
who had been doing practically all of the talking
for the railroad company brought it to a conclusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no more use for a welsher than you
have, Mr. Vallory,&#8221; he said, referring pointedly
to one James Lushing. &#8220;You have frankly admitted
that there have been the usual contractor&#8217;s
shavings and parings on the job, to the manifest
detriment of the railroad company&#8217;s interest. I&#8217;ll
be equally frank and say that Lushing was given
his place with us largely because he knew of the
little parings&mdash;having devised a good many of
them himself, probably&mdash;and was therefore able
to check and prevent them. But I wish it to be
distinctly understood that we don&#8217;t stand for any
highbinding methods; and your evidence of sheer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
criminality on Lushing&#8217;s part seems to be entirely
conclusive. You say they have found the wrecked
time-clock of the infernal machine in the tunnel
digging?&#8221;</p>

<p>David nodded. &#8220;We have that, and the testimony
of the young woman I speak of. Also, we
have another witness in the person of a man
named Dargin, who, my assistant tells me, is
ready to testify that Lushing, the man Backus, and
another named Runnels, deliberately plotted the
blowing up of the tunnel, partly for the purpose of
smashing our company, but principally&mdash;so Dargin
says&mdash;to dispose of me in a manner which
would appear to be entirely accidental.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dargin?&#8221; said the president, with a faint
smile. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he the head and front of these Powder
Can nuisances that you described in your letter
to me, and wished to have us help you clean out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same,&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he know of your effort in this direction?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet he tried to warn you through the
woman Fallon? What sort of a desperado is he,
Mr. Vallory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; David confessed. &#8220;He
is rather beyond me. Desperado is the word; he
has a perfectly horrifying list of shootings to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
credit, and is, generally, what is known west of
civilization as a &#8216;bad man.&#8217; And yet he agreed
with me when I told him that his dives ought to
be cleaned up, and that I was going to try to clean
them up; adding that some day he might do it himself,
if I didn&#8217;t beat him to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be a miracle, indeed,&#8221; said the
railroad president.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet it is one that is already wrought,&#8221; David
put in. &#8220;Mr. Plegg&mdash;my assistant&mdash;assures me
that the Powder Can saloons and gambling dens
were all closed on the night of the tunnel explosion,
and that Dargin had sent him word that
they would not be reopened.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the big-bodied president smiled. &#8220;We
are living in an age of wonders, Mr. Vallory.
This man Dargin&#8217;s action proves it, and, if you
will permit me to say it, so does yours in asking
for this conference. Do you know what has become
of Lushing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not. When it became known, as it was
almost immediately, that the tunnel disaster was
not an accident, Lushing disappeared, together
with his accomplices. But, as I have pointed out,
we have the evidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could scarcely make a legal case against
the railroad company,&#8221; said the president.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
&#8220;Lushing was acting entirely on his own responsibility
when he stepped over into the criminal field
to satisfy his grudge against you and Mr. Grillage.
But I understand from what you have said that
you have no intention of taking the matter into the
courts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None whatever. I am merely asking you gentlemen
for a square deal in return for a square
deal. Our bid on this job was too low, if the work
were to be done honestly. If the railroad company
will allow the slight increase in the estimates
that I have asked for, we shall go on and complete
the job to your entire satisfaction. And you
may cover the entire mileage six feet deep with
inspectors if you choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a little interval of silence to follow
this statement, with some uneasy moving in their
chairs on the part of the four Short Line directors
who had listened to the arguments pro and con.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe in you, Mr. Vallory,&#8221; said the president
at length, slightly stressing the pronoun. &#8220;If
the matter were solely in your hands, I should say,
go ahead on the plan you have outlined. But
what guaranty can you give us that Mr. Grillage
will permit you to carry out your ideas? You
must remember that we have had dealings with
him before this.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>&#8220;Mr. Grillage will not interfere,&#8221; said David
calmly. &#8220;The chief reason is that before the new
plan goes into effect, I shall be his son-in-law and
a partner in the business of the Grillage Engineering
Company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho!&#8221; said the railroad magnate, with a good-natured
chuckle. &#8220;So the wind sets in that quarter,
does it? Are we to understand that you will
have your wife&#8217;s approval and&mdash;er&mdash;co&ouml;peration
in these business matters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the very fullest extent,&#8221; was the prompt
rejoinder. &#8220;In fact, the course I have indicated is
based more upon her initiative than mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is better. I have had the privilege of
meeting Miss Virginia, and&mdash;you are to be congratulated,
most heartily, Mr. Vallory. Did the&mdash;er&mdash;accident
in the tunnel contribute something
toward the bringing about of this happy state of
affairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It did,&#8221; said David shortly. &#8220;You may, or
may not, have heard that Miss Virginia took her
life in her hands to save mine and those of the
men of the day shift.&#8221;</p>

<p>President Ford rose to intimate that the conference
was ended.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll meet you half-way, Mr. Vallory, and in
good faith,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am told you have a lawyer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
friend here in the house; our attorneys will
meet him and draw up new contracts. We shall
ask only for decent economy and fairness; and if
you can do as you promise&mdash;get the line open before
snow flies&mdash;there will be a substantial bonus
for you, individually; which may enable you to
make your interest in the Grillage Engineering
Company a financial as well as a&mdash;er&mdash;sentimental
one. I think that is all we need to say this
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Vallory passed through the corridor to
the Grillage suite with the blood hammering in
his veins. In the hour-long conference with the
railroad magnates he had kept his word to Virginia,
fighting openly and honestly, and battling
his way through to the desired end. The battle
had not been won without stress. At first, there
had been only silence and cold attention on the
part of the magnates. But the triumphant fact
remained: he had warmed them finally and the
victory was won.</p>

<p>But now the real crisis was at hand. Would
Eben Grillage, the benefactor to whom he owed
his fealty in the final analysis, turn the helm over
to a moneyless youngster who was masterfully
proposing to marry his daughter out of hand, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
to throw all of the Grillage business methods and
maxims into the scrap-heap?</p>

<p>Virginia met him at the door of the private
suite, and her eyes were full of trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be prepared for a great change,
David,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;It is paralysis, and he
will never be the same man again. You must help
me, dear; in a way, you know, I was the cause
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll carry the load&mdash;together,&#8221; he assured
her gently, and then she led him to the bedside of
the stricken giant.</p>

<p>Her word of warning did not come amiss. For
a moment David was shocked silent, and he could
scarcely realize that the big figure propped among
the pillows was that of the man who had stood as
the very image of strength and aggressive vigor
at their last meeting on the morning of the departure
for the fishing excursion. The beetle-browed
eyes were undimmed, to be sure, but the heavy
face hung in folds, and its color was that of age-old
parchment. Yet the indomitable spirit was
unbroken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to look over the wreck, have you,
David?&#8221; he said, with the grim Grillage smile
strangely distorted by his malady. &#8220;Makes me
think of that advertisement of the insurance people:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
&#8216;A house may burn, but a man <i>must</i> die.&#8217; I&#8217;m
not dead yet, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you&#8217;re not,&#8221; said David cheerfully.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to be allowed to die before I&#8217;ve
paid you some of the big debt I owe you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the grim smile flitted across the flabby
expanse of the wrecked face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vinnie tells me you&#8217;re aiming to make the debt
bigger before you make it less. Do you realize
that you&#8217;re taking all I&#8217;ve got in the world worth
having, David? But of course you don&#8217;t; you
young robbers never do. Have you seen President
Ford?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I have just had a talk with him and four
of his directors. We are to have a new contract,
with increased estimates, and a square deal all
around. And bygones are to be bygones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eben Grillage rocked his head slowly back and
forth on the pillows, and this time the grim smile
was almost ghastly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have waited until I was safely
under ground, you and Vinnie, before you began
on your Utopian house-wrecking,&#8221; he said, with
a touch of humor that was too bitter to be merely
sardonic. &#8220;Are you trying to tell me that Ford is
going to pay more than the original contract calls
for?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>&#8220;Just that&mdash;for the right kind of work. I had
to argue for a solid hour, but I carried my point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you told him that the old buccaneer
was as good as dead, and that the Golden Rule
had been taken out of its wrappings and polished
up so you could see your face in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the buccaneer&#8217;s daughter broke in,
speaking for the first time in the brisk interchange
of question and reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you torture David that way!&#8221; she
protested. &#8220;He speaks of his debt to you, and
you have spoken of it; can&#8217;t you see that he is
trying to pay it in the biggest, finest way there is?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the big head wagged on the pillows.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll tell me, you two, that it is the day of
the new generation, and that I&#8217;m only a wornout
back-number. Maybe it&#8217;s so. But Utopia isn&#8217;t
here yet, and the world I&#8217;ve fought in ... but
what&#8217;s the use? You two wouldn&#8217;t see it my way
if I should talk till midnight. What is it that you
want to do, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>David slipped an arm around Virginia to make
what he was about to say a joint declaration.</p>

<p>&#8220;We mean to have you live to hear the Grillage
Engineering Company called the squarest contracting
firm in the business; to see the time when
its bid will be the highest one made on a job, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
yet will be the bid that is accepted. That is how
we shall try to pay some part of the big debt.
You&#8217;ll let us try for it, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a full minute the fierce eyes were closed and
the massive figure outlined under the bed-clothes
lay motionless and rigid. When the eyes were
unclosed the king of the contractors was himself
again, in curt decision and terseness of speech, at
least.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have your way, both of you,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t my way, and you can&#8217;t hope to teach an old
dog new tricks. Find Oswald, and we&#8217;ll draw up
some kind of a document that will put you in the
saddle and give you the authority to make the
deal with Ford and his lawyers. And say: tell
Oswald to bring me a cigar&mdash;the blackest one he
can find.... No, I don&#8217;t care a damn what the
doctor says!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a double wedding in the Inn club-room
a week later, the Grillage private car having
been sent all the way to Brewster to bring the
officiating clergyman. Contrary to all precedent&mdash;at
least in Virginia Grillage&#8217;s world&mdash;there was
no formality. The Inn guests were invited in a
body; and on David&#8217;s side there was a crowding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
of engineers in working clothes, of grade foremen
and subcontractors, of all and sundry who could
be spared from the big job.</p>

<p>Eben Grillage, his great body propped in a
wheel-chair, gave one of the brides away; but the
chief interest for the onlookers centered in the
slender, sylph-like figure of the other bride, whose
face, almost other-worldly in its delicate, rose-leaf
beauty, was as the face of an innocent child, and
whose eyes, seeing neither the throng nor the
morning sunlight streaming through the windows
of the transformed lounging-room, were yet shining
with happiness ineffable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I simply <i>can&#8217;t</i> believe she is blind!&#8221; whispered
one white-haired mother of daughters
among the witnesses; and there were others, also,
to wink away the quick-springing tears of sympathy.</p>

<p>Again, contrary to all precedent, there was no
wedding journey to follow the simple ceremony
in the hotel club-room. Almost immediately the
Oswalds went across to the cottage they were to
occupy; and a short half-hour after her marriage,
Virginia Vallory, clad in serviceable khaki, forthfared
with her husband to make a round over
the job.</p>

<p>The sun was setting crimson fires alight in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
Qojogo&#8217;s cloud cap when they returned to a late
dinner. The summerers were thickly clustered on
the Inn porches, and the two who had just reached
the summit of the steep ridge path turned their
backs upon the conventions and their faces toward
the western effulgences.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had the better part of a day to think
about it; are you sorry for that little minute of
confessions in the tunnel, Vinnie?&#8221; David asked,
as one still unable to realize his blessings and the
full magnitude of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry? Why should I be sorry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have had an old and honorable
title, you know,&#8221; he reminded her. &#8220;Cumberleigh
could have given you that much, at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced up with a bewitching little twist of
the lips which carried him swiftly back to childhood
days, and to his memories of her childhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a title,&#8221; she retorted; &#8220;the most honorable
title in all the world. When I die it shall be
graven on my tombstone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Epitaphs&mdash;already?&#8221; he deprecated, with his
sober smile. Then, in a sudden rush of poignant
tenderness: &#8220;Oh, my dear one&mdash;let us hope that
the day is far distant!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amen!&#8221; she said softly; &#8220;because I don&#8217;t want
to leave you, David. But when the day does come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
I shall have my title: I thought of it this afternoon
when we were at McCulloch&#8217;s camp, and I stood
aside and heard you say, &#8216;No, Mac&mdash;do the job
just as if you were doing it for yourself.&#8217; Then
I saw just how my epitaph-title was going to read:
&#8216;Here lies Virginia Vallory, the wife of an honest
man.&#8217; There now; if that crowd wasn&#8217;t looking
on with all its eyes, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d kiss me for
that. Let&#8217;s go in to dinner; I&#8217;m actually unromantic
enough to be fiercely hungry. Good-by,
blessed sunset,&#8221; and she blew a kiss to the crimson
west.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
